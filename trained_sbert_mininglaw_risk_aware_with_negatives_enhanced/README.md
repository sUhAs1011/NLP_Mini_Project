  - "Government of India  \nMinistry of Mines  \n \nNATIONAL MINERAL POLICY, 2008\
    \  \n(For non - fuel and non - coal minerals)  \n \n1. PREAMBLE  \nMiner als are\
    \ a v aluable natural resource being the   vital   raw   material for    infr\
    \ astructure, \ncapital goods and   basic industries. As a major resource   for\
    \ development the extr action and \nmanagement of minerals has to be  integrated\
    \ into the over all strategy of the country’s \neconomic development. The exploitation\
    \  of  minerals  has  to be  guided  by  long -term \nnational  goals  and  perspectives.\
    \ Just as these goals and perspectives are dyn amic and \nresponsive to the changing\
    \ global economic scenario  so also the national mineral policy has \nto be dynamic\
    \ taking into consideration the changing needs of industry in the context of the\
    \ \ndomestic and gl obal economic environment. It is, therefore, necessary to\
    \ revisit the National \nMineral Policy, 1993,  as provided in para 4 of the same,\
    \ and to spell  out  in   a revised \nstatement  the  different  elements  of\
    \  policy,  includi ng elements newly evolved, for the  \ndevelopment   of   the\
    \ mineral  resources of the country.   \n \n2. BASIC FEATURES  \n \n   2.1  The\
    \ country is blessed with ample resources of a number of minerals and has the\
    \ \ngeological environment for many others. To exploit the country’s geological\
    \ potential it is \nimportant that scientific and detailed prospect ing is carried\
    \ out in search of its mineral resources.  \nIt will be en sured that   regional\
    \ and detailed exploration is carried out systematically in the \nentire geologically\
    \ conducive mineral bearing area of the country using state -of-the-art \ntechniques\
    \ in a time bound manner. Minerals being a valuable resource the extractio n of\
    \ mineral \nresources located through exploration and prospecting has to be maximised\
    \ through   scientific \nmethods   of mining, beneficiation and economic   util\
    \ isation. Zero waste mining will be the \nnational goal and mining tech nology\
    \ will be upgraded to ensure extraction and utilisation of the \nentire run -of-mines.\
    \  \n \n2.2   To achieve both these goals of large scale prospecting and optimal\
    \ mining large \ninvestments will be required together with the latest technologies\
    \ in prospecti ng and mining. \nThe regulatory environment will be improved to\
    \ make it more conducive to investment and \ntechnology flows. Capital market\
    \ structures will be developed to attract risk investment into \nsurvey and prospecting.\
    \ Transparency in allocation of conce ssions will be assured. Preference \nmay\
    \ be given to a value addition industry in grant of mineral concession. However,\
    \ this will not in any way undermine the security of tenure to a holder of a concessionaire.\
    \ The \ndevelopment of a proper inventory of resour ces and reserves, a mining\
    \ tenement registry and a \nmineral atlas will be given priority.  Enforcement\
    \ of mining   plans for adoption of proper   \nmining   methods   and optimum\
    \ utilisation of minerals will be ensured. For these purposes the \nGeological\
    \ Surve y of India  (GSI) , the India n Bureau of Mines  (IBM)  and the State\
    \ Directorates \nof Mining & Geology will be strengthened with man power, equipment\
    \ and skill sets upgraded \nto the level of state of the art.  \n \n2.3.     \
    \ Mining is closely linke d with forestry and environment issues. A significant\
    \ part of the \nnation’s known reserves of some important minerals are in areas\
    \ which are under forest cover. \nFurther, mining activity is an intervention\
    \ in the environment and has the potential to disturb \nthe ecological balance\
    \ of an area. However, the needs of economic development make the \nextraction\
    \ of the nation’s mineral resources an important priority.  A framework of sustainable\
    \ \ndevelopment will be designed which takes care of bio diversity issues and\
    \  to ensure that \nmining activity takes place along with suitable measures for\
    \ restoration of the ecological \nbalance. Special care will be taken to protect\
    \ the interest of host and indigenous (tribal) \npopulations through developing\
    \ models of stakeholder inte rest based on international best \npractice. Project\
    \ affected persons will be protected through comprehensive relief and \nrehabilitation\
    \ packages in line with the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement  Policy.\
    \  \n \n 2.4     As the country develops and industry  grows assured availability\
    \ and proximity of \nmineral resources will play an important role in giving a\
    \ competitive edge to Indian industry. \nThe multiplier effect of minerals processed\
    \ into metals on downstream industrialisation cannot \nbe over emphasised. V alue\
    \ addition will, therefore, be actively encouraged. However, such \nvalue addition\
    \ will go hand in hand with the growth of the mineral sector as a stand alone\
    \ \nindustrial activity. While, appropriate  linkages  between  exploitation \
    \ of   minerals and  the ir \nend use including the development  of industry based\
    \ on the minerals will be established \nwherever feasible, a downward curve in\
    \ an industrial sector using a particular mineral within \nthe country need not\
    \ be allowed to effect the growth of mining activit y for that mineral. Hence\
    \ \nemployment and tertiary sector spin offs from both value  addition as well\
    \ as from mining will \nbe encouraged so as to maximise the contribution of the\
    \ mineral sector to the country’s gross \ndomestic product.  \n \n2.5    Mining\
    \ infrastru cture requires a special thrust as the economic efficiency of evacuation\
    \ of    \nminerals from pit mouth to user point or port or rail head is closely\
    \ linked to the end use value \nof the mineral and of the viability of the industry\
    \ using the mineral.  Innovat ive structures will \nbe devised for developing\
    \ and financing the infrastructure needs of the mining sector. While \nassistance\
    \ through viability gap funding will be extended where required the principle\
    \ of user \ncharges and Private Public Participation will be  the basis on which\
    \ mining infrastructure will be \nbuilt.   2.6   India is a federal structure\
    \ with a single economic space. Nevertheless, the legitimate fiscal \ninterests\
    \ of States which are mineral rich need to be protected. The r evenues from minerals\
    \ will \nbe rationalised to e nsure that the mineral bearing S tates get a fair\
    \ share of the value of the \nminerals extracted from their grounds.  New sources\
    \ of rev enue will be developed for the S tates \nand State agencies involved\
    \ in mineral  sector development and regulation will be encouraged to \nmodernise\
    \ in the areas of prospecting as well as regulation. The States will be assisted\
    \ to \novercome the problem of illegal mining through operational and financial\
    \ linkages with the \nIndia n Bureau of  Mines.  \n \n2.7       To enable the\
    \ use of state of the art exploration techniques, scientific mining and optimal\
    \ \nuse of minerals through ore dressing and beneficiation technologies it is\
    \ necessary not only to \npromote research and development in minerals but to\
    \ simultaneously establish appropriate \neducational and training facilities for\
    \ human resources development to meet the manpower \nrequirements of the mineral\
    \ industry.  These matters will receive prime importance and a \ncomp rehensive\
    \ institution al framework for R esearch  & D evelopment,  and Training will be\
    \ \ndeveloped.  \n \n2.8    These aspects constitute the essentials of the new\
    \ National Mineral Policy, 2008. A more \ndetailed approach towards putting these\
    \ essentials into practice and details of other associated \nfeatures of the Policy\
    \ are spelt out in the following paragraphs.  \n \n3.   REGULATION OF MINERALS\
    \  \n \n 3.1.   Management of mineral  resources is the  responsibility  of both\
    \ the  Central  Government  \nand  the  State  Governments  in   terms of  Entry\
    \  54  of the  Union List (List I) and  Entry  23  \nof  the State   List   (List\
    \ II)  of  the  Seventh   Schedule of the Constitution  of  India.   The  \nMines\
    \   and  Minerals ( Development and Regulation)  Act,  1957  (MMDR Act) , lays\
    \  down  the  \nlegal   frame -work for  the  regulation  of mines and  development\
    \  of  all  minerals other    than   \npetroleum   and   natural   gas.  The \
    \ Central Government   has  framed  the  Mineral  Concession   \nRules , 1960\
    \  (MCR)  for   regulating grant  of  reconnaissance permits  (RP) , prospecting\
    \   licences  \n(PL)   and   mining leases  (ML)    in   respect of all minerals\
    \ other than   atomic minerals   and  \nminor  minerals.   The State   Governments\
    \   have framed the rules in regard to minor minerals . \nThe Central Government\
    \   have also framed the Mineral   Conservation   and Development   \nRules, 1988\
    \  (MCDR),  for   conservation   and   systematic development   of   minerals.\
    \    These \nare   applicable   to   all minerals except coal, atomic minerals\
    \ and  minor minerals      \n \n3.2.   The   Central   Government in consultation\
    \ with State Governments shall formulate  the  \nlegal  measures necessary for\
    \ giving effect to the  new National Mineral Policy, 2008 ,  to    \nensure  \
    \  basic    uniformity    in     mineral  administration across the country  and\
    \   to   ensure   \nthat   the   development   of  mineral  resources  keeps \
    \ pace, and is  in  consonance  with  the  national   policy   goals.  The MMDR\
    \ Act, t he MCR and the MCDR will be amended in line with \nthe policy.  The \
    \  regulation   of   mines    and  development   of   mineral  resources  in \
    \ \naccordance   with   the  national   goals  and  priorities as spelt out in\
    \ the policy and the legal \nframework  shal l  be  the   responsibility  of both\
    \ the Central and the State Governments.  \n \n3.3 In order to make the regulatory\
    \ environment conducive to private investment the \nprocedures for grant of mineral\
    \ concessions of all types, such as Reconnaissance Permits, \nProsp ecting Licenses\
    \ and Mining Leases, shall be transparent and seamless and security of \ntenure\
    \ shall be guaranteed to the concessionaries. The first -in-time principle in\
    \ the case of sole \napplicants and the selection criteria in the case of multiple\
    \ applicants  will be appropriately \nelaborated. Prospecting and mining shall\
    \ be recognized as independent activities with \ntransferability of concessions\
    \ playing a key role in mineral sector development.  \n \n4.     ROLE OF THE STATE\
    \ IN MINERAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \nThe  role to be played by the Central and State\
    \ Governments in  regard  to  mineral  development  \nhas  been  extensively \
    \ dealt in  the  Mines  and Minerals (Development and Regulation)  Act, \n1957\
    \  and Rules  made under the Act by  the  Central  Government and  the  State\
    \   Governments \nin their  respective  domains.   The provisions  of  the  Act\
    \  and the Rules  will  be  reviewed  and  \nharmonised  with  the basic features\
    \ of the new N ational Mineral Policy .  In fu ture the core \nfunctions of the\
    \ S tate in mining will be facil itation and regulation of exploration and mining\
    \ \nactivities of investors and entrepreneurs, provision of infrastructure and\
    \ tax collection.  In mining \nactivities, there shall be arms length distance\
    \  between State agencies (P ublic Sector \nUndertakings ) that mine and those\
    \ that regulate.  There shall be transparency and fair play in the \nreservation\
    \  of ore bodies to State agencies on such areas where private players are not\
    \ holding or \nhave not applied for exploration or mining, unless security considerations\
    \ or  specific public \ninterests are involved.  \n \n5.         SURVEY AND EXPLORATION\
    \  \n \n5.1.   The Geological Survey of India is the principal agency for geological\
    \ mapping and    \nregional    mineral     resources assessment of the country.\
    \    It shall  be  responsib le  for  drawing  \nup  action oriented plans towards\
    \ these ends in close cooperation with  all  other  agencies  \nengaged in  this\
    \  task.  Detailed exploration   on   land   is   done   by   the Mineral Exploration\
    \ \nCorporation, Directorates   of Mining and G eology of the State Governments\
    \ and various Central \nand   State   Public Sector Organisations. In conducting\
    \ exploration for minerals special attention \nwill be given by these government\
    \ agencies to the development of strategic minerals through \nsystematic i nvestigation\
    \ of potential sources which are difficult to otherwise access.  \n 5.2     While\
    \ these Government agencies will continue to perform the tasks assigned to them\
    \ for \nexploration and survey, the private sector would in future be the main\
    \ source of inv estment in  \nreconnaissance and exploration and government agencies\
    \ will expend public funds primarily in \nareas where private sector investments\
    \ are not forthcoming despite the desirability of \nprogrammes due to reasons\
    \ such as high uncertainties. To expedite  completion of reconnaissance \nwork\
    \ for the entire country as early as possible an open sky policy of non -exclusivity\
    \ for \nreconnaissance work will be adopted. At the same time to attract large\
    \ investments and high \ntechnology a new instrument to be known as Large Area\
    \ Prospecting License will be introduced. \nHowever such bulk minerals which do\
    \ not need risk investment and high technology will not be \neligible for Large\
    \ Area Prospecting License. The durations of all concessions will be rationalised\
    \ \nand areas of operations enlarged suitably within each state.   \n \n5.3  \
    \   It is necessary to ensure that India’s exclusive economic zone is explored\
    \ and exploited to \nthe maximum possible extent. The Ministry of Earth Sciences\
    \ (MoES)  and its agencies    are \nentrusted with  the task of sea -bed exploration\
    \ and mining.  Cooperation between MoES  and GSI \nwill be institutionalised so\
    \ as to achieve this objective within a time bound framework. The task \nof mapping\
    \ out the extended economic zone will be expedited and completed withi n the time\
    \ \nprescribed by the International Sea Convention so that no area of sea bed\
    \ mining is lost to the \ncountry.  \n \n5.4     Particular  attention  will be\
    \ given  to  the  survey  and  exploration  of  minerals  in  which  \nthe  country\
    \  has a poor resource -cum-reserve  base despite having the geological potential\
    \ for \nlarge resources. Minerals for which there is demand within the country\
    \ either for use or for \nexport after processing will be prioritised.  Exploration\
    \ for lower grade hematite, magnetite, base \nmetals, noble metals, diamonds and\
    \ high grade Ilmenite will be put on the fast track.   \n \n5.5      Coordination\
    \ of the regional exploration work by government agencies is at  present  \nbeing\
    \  done   by  the  Central  Programming  Board  of  the Geological  S urvey  of\
    \  India.  The \ndisaggregated projects are generally discussed in the State Level\
    \ Committees and other technical \nforums before being incorporated into the annual\
    \ programme. The existing arrangement shall be \nrevamped to ensure that projects\
    \ and progr ammes are prioritised in line with the national policy \ngoals and\
    \ are chalked out after taking into account the exploration work undertaken by\
    \ the \nprivate sector.  \n \n6. DATA BASE OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND TENEMENTS\
    \  \n \n6.1.    The national inventory of mineral re sources will be based on\
    \ a comprehensive and up to \ndate review of exploration data. In coordination\
    \ with Geological Survey of India, the Indian \nBureau of Mines will maintain\
    \ a database in digitised form comprising both a Resource \nInventory and a Tenement\
    \ R egistry. The resource inventory will be in accordance with the latest version\
    \ of the UNFC system showing reserves and remaining resources as well in the traditional\
    \ \nIBM form of resources and probable and proven reserves.  The Tenement Registry\
    \ will give \ninformation of both Leasehold Areas as well as Freehold Areas in\
    \ terms of green field, brown \nfield and relinquished areas including areas given\
    \ up by the GSI and other RP/PL holders as not \npursued. The data would be maintained\
    \ online giving instant informati on to prospective investors \non what is available\
    \ for reconnaissance, prospecting and mining. Summaries of work done by \npublic\
    \ agencies will be kept in the form of meta -data in the public domain and detailed\
    \ reports \nwill be made available to interested inve stors on cost recovery basis.\
    \  \n \n6.2     Data filing requirements will be rigorously applied and all concession\
    \ holders will be \nsubjected to detailed moni toring in this regard. The lock\
    \ -in arrangements will be assured and \nreleased data will be integrated with\
    \ the data generated by the state agencies and made available \nto other prospectors.\
    \  \n \n7.     STRATEGY OF MINERAL DEVELOPMENT  \n7.1 General Strategy  \n \n\
    The  Strategy  for  development  of  any  mineral  should naturally  keep  in\
    \  view its ultimate  \nend  uses in terms of demand and supply in the short,\
    \ medium and long terms.   The  guiding \nprinciple  in  the  strategy of development\
    \  of  any  mineral  or mineral   deposit  at  any  location  \nshall  ordinarily\
    \  be  the economic cost of recovery i.e extraction cost relative to market price\
    \ and \nwill hence be determined by the market. However, a disaggregated approach\
    \ in respect of each \nmineral will be adopted  and a mineral specific strategy\
    \ will be developed. To maximise gains \nfrom the comparative advantage which\
    \ the country enjoys intra se  mineral development will be \nprioritised in terms\
    \ of import substitution, value addition and export, in that order.  \n \n7.2.\
    \   Conservation and Mineral Development  \n \nConservation  of minerals shall\
    \ be construed not  in  the restrictive    sense   of   abstinence   \nfrom  \
    \ consumption    or preservation   for  use in the distant future  but  as  a\
    \   positive   concept \nleading to au gmentation of  reserve base  through improvement\
    \ in  mining methods,  \nbeneficiation  and  utilisation of   low   grade  ore\
    \  and  rejects and   recovery  of associated \nminerals.   There shall be an\
    \ adequate and effective legal and institutional framework mandating \nzero-waste\
    \ mining as the ultimate goal and a commitment to prevent sub -optimal and \n\
    unscientific mining. Non -adherence to the Mining Plan based on these parameters\
    \ will carry \nrepercussions. Mineral sectoral value addition through latest techniques\
    \ o f beneficiation, \ncalibration, blending, sizing, concentration, pelletisation,\
    \ purification and general customisation \nof product will be encouraged. This\
    \ is particularly important in iron ore mining as about 80% of \nthe iron ore\
    \ produced in the country is in  the form of Fines and to promote such value addition\
    \ \nfiscal and non fiscal incentives will be considered. A thrust will be given\
    \ to exploitation of mineral resources in which the country is well endowed so\
    \ that the needs of domestic industry \nare fully met  keeping in mind both present\
    \ and future needs, while at the same time exploiting \nthe external markets for\
    \ such minerals.  \n \n7.3   Scientific Methods of Mining  \n \nMine  development\
    \ and mineral conservation as governed  by the   rules   and  regulations  will\
    \  \nbe  on   sound   scientific basis, with the regulatory agencies, viz. IBM\
    \ and the State Directorates, \nclosely  interacting with R&D organisation,  and\
    \ scientific  and  professional   bodies to ensure \noptimal Mining Plans. Conditions\
    \  of  mining  leases  re garding   size,  shape, disposition   with   \nreference\
    \  to  geological   boundaries   and other   mining  conditions  shall  be  such\
    \  as   to   \nfavourably predispose   the   leased  areas  to  systematic   and\
    \   complete extraction of minerals. \nThe regula tory agencies, namely the India\
    \ n Bureau of Mines and the State Directorates will be \nsuitably strengthened\
    \ through capacity building measures.  \n \n7.4   Mining as an Industry with Linkages\
    \  \n \nMining contributes to the generation of wealth and creation of employm\
    \ ent independently and \nshould therefore be treated as an economic activity\
    \ in its own right and not merely as an ancillary \nactivity of manufacturing\
    \ industry.  Domestic processing industry receives supplies of mineral \nresources\
    \ produced by the mining indust ry at market prices prevailing from time to time.\
    \  In \norder to be assured of uninterrupted supply of the mineral raw material\
    \ from domestic sources \nthe user industry will be encouraged to develop long\
    \ -term linkages with the mineral producing \nunits includin g equity participation\
    \ in such mining companies .  The mineral  processing  unit \nshould  not  only\
    \  get  an assured  supply  of  the  mineral  raw material   but   should   also\
    \  have   \nclose   links   with   the production  and  marketing  agencies of\
    \  the   mineral  based  end \nproducts. Mining as a backward linkage and Value\
    \ addition within the same state as a forward \nlinkage will, therefore, be encouraged.\
    \  \n \n7.5   Mining Equipment and Machinery  \n \nIndigenous industry for manufacture\
    \ of mining equipment and ma chinery shall be strengthened. \nInduction of foreign\
    \ technology and participation for this purpose will be encouraged. Use of \n\
    equipment and machinery which improve the efficiency, productivity and economics\
    \ of mining \noperations and safety and health of pers ons working in the mines\
    \ and surrounding areas shall be \nencouraged. Import of such equipment and machinery\
    \ shall be freely allowed.  \n \n \n \n 7.6.   Manpower Development  \nExisting\
    \  facilities  for basic and  specialised  training  shall be constantly  reviewed\
    \ and \nupgraded from  time  to  time  to  ensure  that  adequately trained manpower\
    \ at  all  levels  is  \navailable   for   the   development   of   mines   and\
    \   mineral s.  \n \nIn  order to improve the competitive edge of the  national\
    \ mining  industry,  emphasis  shall  be  \nlaid  on   mechanisation, computerisation\
    \   and   automation  of  the  existing   and   new mining  \nunits.   The man\
    \ power development programme shall b e suitably reoriented for the purpose. \
    \ \n \nAs the mining sector takes off, the country will need more and more mining\
    \ engineers, \ngeologists, geo -physicists, geo -chemists and geo -instrumentation\
    \ specialists. A comprehensive \nreview of the sector’s man power ne eds will\
    \ be undertaken and educational institutions will be \ngeared to meeting these\
    \ needs in the medium and long term.  \n \n7.7. Infrastructure Development  \n\
    \ \nMineral deposits generally occur in remote and backward areas with poor infrastructural\
    \   \nfacilities   which   often inhibit   their optimum development. A major\
    \ thrust needs   to   be   \ngiven to development of infrastructural facilities\
    \ in mineral bearing areas with special emphasis \non Linking Infrastructure.\
    \ Financial resources available with government w ill be leveraged to the \nmaximum\
    \ extent possible through recourse to user charge based public -private -partnership\
    \ \narrangements wherever possible by providing an institutional framework. An\
    \ enabling \nenvironment will be created to motivate large capacity mini ng companies\
    \ to undertake \nconstruction of transportation net works (road and rail) on their\
    \ own.  \n \nThe contribution of mineral development to regional and more specifically\
    \ peripheral \ndevelopment, commensurate with the huge investment in large mining\
    \ projec ts, is substantial.  In \nso far as public funding of infrastructure\
    \ is concerned a  much greater thrust will be given to \ndevelopment of health,\
    \ education, drinking water, road and other related facilities and \ninfrastructure\
    \ in mineral bearing areas so that an integrated approach emerges, encompassing\
    \ \nmineral development, regional development and the social and economic well\
    \ being of  the local, \nand particularly, tribal population.  \n \n \n7.8 Financial\
    \ Support for Mining   \nMining is an eligible activity for obtaining f inancial\
    \ support    from   financial   institutions.    \nHowever, at present   only\
    \ those mining projects   which   have a substantial   component   of   \nmining\
    \ machinery,   equipment   and buildings   are being financed. Steps  shall  be\
    \  taken  to  \nfacili tate   financing  of  mine development  and  also  of exploration\
    \  integral  to  the  mining \nproject.   \nProspecting being a high risk venture,\
    \ access to “risk funds” from capital markets and venture \nfunds will be facilitated.\
    \ Early stage Exploration and Min ing companies will be encouraged and \ndifferential\
    \ listing requirements through segmented exchanges will be explored. Induction\
    \ of \nforeign technology and foreign participation in exploration and mining\
    \ for high   value   and   \nscarce minerals   shall be pur sued.   Foreign equity\
    \ investment in joint ventures for exploration \nand mining promoted by Indian\
    \ Companies will be encouraged.    \n \n7.9 Small Deposits  \n \nSmall and isolated\
    \ deposits of minerals are scattered all over the country. These often lend \n\
    themselves to e conomic exploitation   through   small   scale mining. With modest\
    \ demand on \ncapital expenditure and short lead -time, they provide employment\
    \ opportunities for the local \npopulation. However, due to diseconomies of scale\
    \ they can also lead to sub -optimal mi ning and \necological disturbance. Efforts\
    \ will be  made to promote small scale mining of  small  deposits  \nin  a  scientific\
    \ and efficient manner while safeguarding  vital environmental and ecological\
    \   \nimperatives. Regulation of these conditionalities will  be tightened so\
    \ as to control and prevent \nthe growth of illegal mining    \n \nWhere small\
    \ deposits are not susceptible to viable mining a cluster approach will be adopted\
    \ by \ngranting the deposits together as a single lease within a geographically\
    \ defined bou ndary. Efforts \nwould be made to grant such mineral concessions\
    \ to consortia of small scale miners so that such \nclusters of small deposits\
    \ will enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale.  \n \nIn grant\
    \ of   mineral concessions for small deposits in Scheduled Areas, preference shall\
    \ be given \nto Scheduled Tribes singly or as cooperatives.  \n \n \n7.10. Mineral\
    \ Development & Protection of Environment  \n \nExtraction  of  minerals closely\
    \ impacts  other  nat ural  resources  like  land,  water, air  and  \nforest.\
    \   The  areas  in  which  minerals  occur  often have  other  resources  presenting\
    \ a  choice  \nof  utilisation  of the   resources.   Some such areas are ecologically\
    \   fragile and some are \nbiologically  rich.   It  is  necessary  to  take a\
    \ comprehensive   view  to  facilitate  the  choice  or  \norder   of land  use\
    \  keeping  in  view the needs  of  development  as  well as   needs   of   \n\
    protecting   the   forests,   environment   and ecology.   Both  as pects  have\
    \  to  be  properly  \ncoordinated  to facilitate  and  ensure  a  sustainable\
    \  development  of  mineral resources in \nharmony with environment.  \n Mining\
    \ activity often leads to environmental problems like land  degradation in  opencast\
    \ mining \nand  la nd subsidence  in underground  mining, deforestation, atmospheric\
    \   pollution,   pollution  \nof  rivers   and   streams, soil erosion due disposal\
    \   of  solid  wastes like overburden and so on, \nall  affecting   the   ecological\
    \ balance  of  the  area.  Open -cast mining in areas with actual forest   \n\
    cover   leads   to   deforestation.    Prevention    and mitigation  of  adverse\
    \  environmental  \neffects  due  to   mining  of  minerals  and  repairing  and\
    \   re -vegetation of the affected forest \narea and land co vered by trees in\
    \ accordance with the latest internationally acceptable norms and \nmodern afforestation\
    \ practices  shall form integral part of mine development  strategy in every \n\
    instance.  All mining shall be undertaken within the parameters of a comprehen\
    \ sive Sustainable \nDevelopment Framework which will be so devised as to take\
    \ all these aspects into consideration. \nThe guiding principle shall be that\
    \ a miner shall leave the mining area in better ecological shape \nthan he found\
    \ it.  \n \nMining operations shall n ot ordinarily be taken up in identified\
    \    ecologically   fragile   and   \nbiologically    rich areas.    Strip  mining\
    \  in  forest  areas  should    be  avoided  and  it  should  \nbe  permitted\
    \  only  when accompanied    with    comprehensive    time -bound    reclamation\
    \ \nprogramme.  \n \nNo mining lease would be granted to any party, private or\
    \ public,   without   a   proper   mining   \nplan   including the environmental\
    \ management plan approved and enforced by statutory   \nauthorities. The  environmental\
    \   manage ment   plan should  adequately  provide  for  controlling  \nthe  environmental\
    \ damage, restoration  of  mined  areas  and  for   planting   of trees   according\
    \   \nto   the  prescribed  norms. As   far   as possible, reclamation   and \
    \  afforestation    will     proceed \nconcurrently with mineral extraction. \
    \ \n \nEfforts would be made to convert old disused mining sites into forests\
    \ and other appropriate \nforms of land use.  \n \n7.11 Relief & Rehabilitation\
    \ of Displaced and Affected Persons  \n \nMining operations often  involve acquisition\
    \ of land held by individuals including those \nbelonging to the weaker sections.\
    \ In all such cases a social impact assessment will be undertaken \nto ensure\
    \ that suitable Relief and Rehabilitation packages are evolved. While compensation\
    \ is  \ngenerally paid to the owner for his acquired land, rehabilitation of affected\
    \ persons in the form of \nsubstitute land, land for housing and jobs is not always\
    \ adequate. Appropriate compensation will \nform an important aspect of the Sustainable\
    \ Development F ramework mentioned in para 2.3 and \n7.10 above. In so far as\
    \ indigenous (tribal)  populations are concerned the Framework shall \nincorporate\
    \ models of stakeholder interest for them in the mining operation, especially\
    \  in \nsituations where  the  weaker  sectio ns  like the local tribal populations\
    \ are likely  to  be  \ndeprived  of  their  means  of  livelihood  as  a result\
    \ of the mining intervention.  In areas in which minerals occur and which are\
    \ inhabited by tribal communities and weaker \nsections it is imperat ive to recognize\
    \ resettlement and rehabilitation issues as intrinsic to the \ndevelopment process\
    \ of the affected zone.  Thus all measures proposed to be taken will be \nformulated\
    \ with the active participation of the affected persons, rather than externally\
    \ i mposed.  \nA careful assessment of the economic, environmental and social\
    \ impact on the affected persons \nwill be made.  A mechanism will be evolved\
    \ which would actually improve the living standards \nof the affected population\
    \ and ensure for them a sustainable  income above the poverty line.  For \nthis\
    \ purpose, all the provisions of the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement\
    \ Policy or any \nrevised Policy or Statute that may come into operation, will\
    \ be followed.  \n  \n7.12 Mine Closures  \n \nOnce the  process  of  econo mical\
    \  extraction  of  a mine is  complete  there  is  need  for \nscientific mine\
    \  closure which will not only restore ecology and regenerate bio mass but also\
    \ take \ninto account the socio -economic aspects of such closure.  Where mining\
    \   activities  have  b een  \nspread  over a few decades,  mining  communities\
    \  get  established  and  closure  of the mine \nmeans  not  only  loss  of  jobs\
    \  but  also  disruption of  community  life.   Whenever  mine  \nclosure   becomes\
    \   necessary,   it   should   be   orderly   and  systematic  and  so  planned\
    \  as to  \nhelp  the  workers  and  the  dependent   community  rehabilitate\
    \  themselves   without   undue  \nhardship.  \n \n7.13. Mine Safety  \n \nMining\
    \ operations are hazardous in nature.   Accidents  happen  and  often  result\
    \  in  the  loss  of  \nlife  or  limb  of  persons  engaged  in  it.   Efforts\
    \  must  be  directed   towards  the  development  \nand  adoption of  mining\
    \  methods  which  would  increase  the  safety  of  workers  and  reduce  \n\
    the   accidents.  Towards   this end, participation and cooperation   of   mine\
    \ workers   shall be \nsecured.   Steps  will  also  be  taken   to  minimise\
    \   the  adverse  impact  of  mining  on  the  \nhealth   of  workers and the\
    \ surrounding population.  \n \n8.     FOREIGN TRADE  \n \nMinerals continue to\
    \ be an important source of foreign exchange earnings.   The  policy of export\
    \ \nshall  keep  in  view  the dynamics of  mineral  inventories as well as the\
    \ short, medium  and long  \nterm  needs  of  the  country.   Efforts  shall \
    \ be made  to  export  minerals  in  value  added  form  \nas  far as  possible.\
    \      The  indigenous   mineral  industry   shall  be  attuned  to  the   \n\
    international   economic  situation  in  order   to derive maximum  advantage\
    \  from  foreign  trade   \nby   carefully   anticipating   technology   and \
    \  demand  changes   in   the   international  market   \nfor   minerals.  \n\
    \ The import of mineral based material shall be coordinated as   far   as possibl\
    \ e with the \nindigenous   development   of mineral   based   industries.   \
    \ Areas   of   cooperation    with \ncountries    with   complementary   resource\
    \   base   shall    be developed for mutual advantage.   \nThe approach   shall\
    \ be to make available mineral  based materials to domestic users at \nreasonable\
    \ prices as determined by market forces.  \n \nA long term export policy would\
    \ provide stability and prove to be an incentive for investing in \nlarge scale\
    \ commercial mining activity.  To develop mining as a modern stand alone industry\
    \ \nsubstantial investment is required. Assurances on export of minerals will\
    \ be a key factor for \ninvestment decisions particularly on FDI in the sector.\
    \  The Export Policy should be based on a \nclear long term strategy for export\
    \ of minera ls taking these aspects into consideration.  \n \n9.     FISCAL ASPECTS\
    \  \n \nIt will be the endeavour of government, within the context of the budget,\
    \ to design fiscal \nmeasures conducive to the promotion of mineral exploration\
    \ and development including \nbeneficiatio n and other forms of product refinement.\
    \  In the context of the   changing mineral \nscenario and the economies of mineral\
    \ development and products, both at the national and \ninternational level fiscal\
    \ changes will be examined from time to time consistent wit h the general \ntax\
    \ structure and through the normal budgetary process.  Mineral prices should reflect\
    \ their value \nand the royalty structures will be designed to ensure that the\
    \ producer earns and the consumer \npays the true value of the minerals produced\
    \ and  consumed. The fiscal dispensation will \ngenerally aim to ensure that adequate\
    \ compensation is forthcoming to the state in return for the \nconcessions it\
    \ grants.  \n \n10. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  \n \n10.1. General Approach   \n\
    \ \nResearch  and development in the mineral  sector  has  to cover  the  entire\
    \  gamut of  activities  \nfrom  geological survey, exploration, mining, beneficiation,\
    \ concentration  of minerals  to \ndevelopment of materials.  Efforts  will  be\
    \  directed towards  the  development  of  new \ntechnologies   for  conv ersion\
    \  of  existing  mineral   resources into   viable  economic  resources.    \n\
    Appropriate   technologies shall   be   developed  to  enable   indigenous   industries\
    \   to utilise   \nthe  mineral  resources  with  which  the  country   is abundantly\
    \   end owed  and  as  substitutes  \nfor  minerals   whose reserves  are  poor.\
    \   R&D efforts shall be directed to find new   and \nalternative uses for minerals\
    \   whose   traditional demand is on the wane. Indigenous technology \nhas to\
    \ be upgraded through research an d   appropriate absorption and adoption   of\
    \   \ntechnological innovations abroad.   Research  and  development  efforts\
    \  shall be  made  to  \nimprove  efficiency  in  process,  operations   and also\
    \    the   recovery   of   by -products   and   reduction    i n specification\
    \  and  consumption  norms.   Efforts will also   be directed to evolve \nlow\
    \ capital and energy saving processing systems.  \n \n10.2. Research in Mining\
    \ Methods  \n \nMining methods determine the safety, economy, speed and the percentage\
    \ of extraction of the \nore reserves from a mine. Research and development thrust\
    \ shall be directed specially in the \nareas of rock mechanics, ground control,\
    \ mine   design engineering, equ ipment   deployment   \nand maintenance,   energy\
    \ conservation, environmental protection, safety of operations and \nhuman engineering.\
    \  \n \n10.3   Mineral Processing and Beneficiation  \n \nAttention will be given\
    \ to beneficiation and agglomeration techniques to brin g lower grades and \n\
    finer size   material into use. Research  organisations,  including the  National\
    \  Mineral \nProcessing   Laboratories   of  the  Indian   Bureau   of   Mines\
    \ will be   strengthened  for  \ndevelopment  of   processes   for beneficiation\
    \   a nd  mineral  and  elemental  analysis  of   ores \nand   ore   dressing\
    \  products.   There shall   be   cooperation between and coordination among all\
    \ \norganisations in public and private sector engaged in this task. Research\
    \  and  development  shall \nbe  orie nted  to  ensure maximum   economic  recovery\
    \  of  the  associated  minerals   and \nvaluable metals.  \n \n10.4 Development\
    \ Of Automated Equipment  \n \nTo  meet the objective of safety and  economic\
    \  production attention   will  be  given  to  the  \ndevelopment  of   robotics,\
    \ automated  equipment  and  system  for  mining,  especially   for deep \nmining\
    \ and transportation to surface.  \n \n10.5.  Deep Sea Mining  \n \nIndia is a\
    \ pioneer investor and has been allocated a mine site   of   150,000 square kilometres\
    \ in \nIndian   O cean   for exclusive   survey   and exploration.   Deep   ocean\
    \   resources represent an \nexceptionally large and potentially   important mineral\
    \   resource.    Integrated   systems   for    \nexploration, exploitation,  \
    \ mining   and processing   of   these   resources shall   be   expedited \nwith\
    \   the   development/acquisition   of necessary     technologies.     Appropriate\
    \     mechanism     \nfor coordinating   the survey and exploration of Deep Sea\
    \   Bed Area    will   be established by \nthe   Ministry of Ea rth Sciences .\
    \  \n \n \n 10.6  Production Of Materials Of High Purity  \n \nResearch  will\
    \ be directed towards raw materials  required  for   production  of  materials\
    \  of  \nhigh  purity  for   use   in  advanced   technology  applications  such\
    \   as   semi -conductors,   \nphoto -voltaic,   lasers,  special  sensors,  \
    \ high   temperature  new    ceramics,   hard   and   high    \ntemperature  \
    \  materials,  superconductors,   insulators,  very  thin  films,  glasses   and\
    \  liquid \ncrystals and metal and mineral fibres.  \n \n10.7.  Coordination Of\
    \ Research Organisations  \n \nResearch and development activities in the mineral\
    \  sector are  carried  out  in  the  national  \nlaboratories,   educational\
    \ institutions   and  R&D  units  of  public  and  private   sector \nenterprises.\
    \   Pooling  of  resources  and  expertise   available in  the  various  R&D \n\
    Organisations is  imperative  to  meet  the challenges  and  to  fulfil  the \
    \ tasks  ahead  in  the   \nmineral sector.    Linkages   and   interaction  \
    \ between   the   various institutions  en gaged  in  \nR&D in the  mineral  sector\
    \  shall  be strengthened  to  derive  the maximum  benefit.   \nInterchange of\
    \ scientists   between   institutions shall   be   encouraged   to accelerate\
    \ the pace of \ninteraction. It shall also be ensured that the resear ch findings\
    \ are made available to users \nexpeditiously. There shall   be   cooperation\
    \ between and coordination among all organisations in \nthe public and private\
    \ sectors engaged in this task.  \n \nMining methods determine the safety, economy,\
    \ speed and the per centage of extraction of the \nore reserves from a mine. Research\
    \ and development thrust needs to be  directed in areas of such \nas rock mechanics,\
    \ ground  control, mine design engineering, equipment deployment and \nmaintenance,\
    \ energy conservation, environmen tal protection, safety of  operations and human\
    \ \nengineering. This has to be done in a holistic way so that inter -linkages\
    \ are established to the \nadvantage of each segment. To this end the diverse\
    \ research, development and training initiatives \nwithin the pu blic domain shall\
    \ be reorganised into a single and cohesive R & D and Training \ninstitution of\
    \ excellence to be known as the National Institute of Mineral Development. \n\
    Organizations such as the  National  Mineral Processing   Laboratories of the\
    \ Indian Bure au of \nMines, the National Institute of Rock mechanics, the Jawaharlal\
    \ National Institute of Aluminium \nResearch and Development, the R & D initiatives\
    \ of the Geological Survey of India will be \njoined to provide a collective thrust.\
    \  \n \n11.    CONCLUSIONS  \n \nMineral wealth, though finite and non -renewable\
    \ in the long term, is a major resource for \ndevelopment.   The  need for a well\
    \ planned programme of survey and exploration, management  \nof  resources which\
    \ have already been discovered and those which are in t he process of \ndiscovery\
    \  and  their optimal, economical and timely use are  matters  of national  importance.\
    \   The success of the second national mineral policy will depend largely on a\
    \ national consensus   \nto fulfil its underlying principles and objectiv es.\

  - "Government of India  \nMinistry of Mines  \n \nNATIONAL MINERAL POLICY, 2008\
    \  \n(For non - fuel and non - coal minerals)  \n \n1. PREAMBLE  \nMiner als are\
    \ a v aluable natural resource being the   vital   raw   material for    infr\
    \ astructure, \ncapital goods and   basic industries. As a major resource   for\
    \ development the extr action and \nmanagement of minerals has to be  integrated\
    \ into the over all strategy of the country’s \neconomic development. The exploitation\
    \  of  minerals  has  to be  guided  by  long -term \nnational  goals  and  perspectives.\
    \ Just as these goals and perspectives are dyn amic and \nresponsive to the changing\
    \ global economic scenario  so also the national mineral policy has \nto be dynamic\
    \ taking into consideration the changing needs of industry in the context of the\
    \ \ndomestic and gl obal economic environment. It is, therefore, necessary to\
    \ revisit the National \nMineral Policy, 1993,  as provided in para 4 of the same,\
    \ and to spell  out  in   a revised \nstatement  the  different  elements  of\
    \  policy,  includi ng elements newly evolved, for the  \ndevelopment   of   the\
    \ mineral  resources of the country.   \n \n2. BASIC FEATURES  \n \n   2.1  The\
    \ country is blessed with ample resources of a number of minerals and has the\
    \ \ngeological environment for many others. To exploit the country’s geological\
    \ potential it is \nimportant that scientific and detailed prospect ing is carried\
    \ out in search of its mineral resources.  \nIt will be en sured that   regional\
    \ and detailed exploration is carried out systematically in the \nentire geologically\
    \ conducive mineral bearing area of the country using state -of-the-art \ntechniques\
    \ in a time bound manner. Minerals being a valuable resource the extractio n of\
    \ mineral \nresources located through exploration and prospecting has to be maximised\
    \ through   scientific \nmethods   of mining, beneficiation and economic   util\
    \ isation. Zero waste mining will be the \nnational goal and mining tech nology\
    \ will be upgraded to ensure extraction and utilisation of the \nentire run -of-mines.\
    \  \n \n2.2   To achieve both these goals of large scale prospecting and optimal\
    \ mining large \ninvestments will be required together with the latest technologies\
    \ in prospecti ng and mining. \nThe regulatory environment will be improved to\
    \ make it more conducive to investment and \ntechnology flows. Capital market\
    \ structures will be developed to attract risk investment into \nsurvey and prospecting.\
    \ Transparency in allocation of conce ssions will be assured. Preference \nmay\
    \ be given to a value addition industry in grant of mineral concession. However,\
    \ this will not in any way undermine the security of tenure to a holder of a concessionaire.\
    \ The \ndevelopment of a proper inventory of resour ces and reserves, a mining\
    \ tenement registry and a \nmineral atlas will be given priority.  Enforcement\
    \ of mining   plans for adoption of proper   \nmining   methods   and optimum\
    \ utilisation of minerals will be ensured. For these purposes the \nGeological\
    \ Surve y of India  (GSI) , the India n Bureau of Mines  (IBM)  and the State\
    \ Directorates \nof Mining & Geology will be strengthened with man power, equipment\
    \ and skill sets upgraded \nto the level of state of the art.  \n \n2.3.     \
    \ Mining is closely linke d with forestry and environment issues. A significant\
    \ part of the \nnation’s known reserves of some important minerals are in areas\
    \ which are under forest cover. \nFurther, mining activity is an intervention\
    \ in the environment and has the potential to disturb \nthe ecological balance\
    \ of an area. However, the needs of economic development make the \nextraction\
    \ of the nation’s mineral resources an important priority.  A framework of sustainable\
    \ \ndevelopment will be designed which takes care of bio diversity issues and\
    \  to ensure that \nmining activity takes place along with suitable measures for\
    \ restoration of the ecological \nbalance. Special care will be taken to protect\
    \ the interest of host and indigenous (tribal) \npopulations through developing\
    \ models of stakeholder inte rest based on international best \npractice. Project\
    \ affected persons will be protected through comprehensive relief and \nrehabilitation\
    \ packages in line with the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement  Policy.\
    \  \n \n 2.4     As the country develops and industry  grows assured availability\
    \ and proximity of \nmineral resources will play an important role in giving a\
    \ competitive edge to Indian industry. \nThe multiplier effect of minerals processed\
    \ into metals on downstream industrialisation cannot \nbe over emphasised. V alue\
    \ addition will, therefore, be actively encouraged. However, such \nvalue addition\
    \ will go hand in hand with the growth of the mineral sector as a stand alone\
    \ \nindustrial activity. While, appropriate  linkages  between  exploitation \
    \ of   minerals and  the ir \nend use including the development  of industry based\
    \ on the minerals will be established \nwherever feasible, a downward curve in\
    \ an industrial sector using a particular mineral within \nthe country need not\
    \ be allowed to effect the growth of mining activit y for that mineral. Hence\
    \ \nemployment and tertiary sector spin offs from both value  addition as well\
    \ as from mining will \nbe encouraged so as to maximise the contribution of the\
    \ mineral sector to the country’s gross \ndomestic product.  \n \n2.5    Mining\
    \ infrastru cture requires a special thrust as the economic efficiency of evacuation\
    \ of    \nminerals from pit mouth to user point or port or rail head is closely\
    \ linked to the end use value \nof the mineral and of the viability of the industry\
    \ using the mineral.  Innovat ive structures will \nbe devised for developing\
    \ and financing the infrastructure needs of the mining sector. While \nassistance\
    \ through viability gap funding will be extended where required the principle\
    \ of user \ncharges and Private Public Participation will be  the basis on which\
    \ mining infrastructure will be \nbuilt.   2.6   India is a federal structure\
    \ with a single economic space. Nevertheless, the legitimate fiscal \ninterests\
    \ of States which are mineral rich need to be protected. The r evenues from minerals\
    \ will \nbe rationalised to e nsure that the mineral bearing S tates get a fair\
    \ share of the value of the \nminerals extracted from their grounds.  New sources\
    \ of rev enue will be developed for the S tates \nand State agencies involved\
    \ in mineral  sector development and regulation will be encouraged to \nmodernise\
    \ in the areas of prospecting as well as regulation. The States will be assisted\
    \ to \novercome the problem of illegal mining through operational and financial\
    \ linkages with the \nIndia n Bureau of  Mines.  \n \n2.7       To enable the\
    \ use of state of the art exploration techniques, scientific mining and optimal\
    \ \nuse of minerals through ore dressing and beneficiation technologies it is\
    \ necessary not only to \npromote research and development in minerals but to\
    \ simultaneously establish appropriate \neducational and training facilities for\
    \ human resources development to meet the manpower \nrequirements of the mineral\
    \ industry.  These matters will receive prime importance and a \ncomp rehensive\
    \ institution al framework for R esearch  & D evelopment,  and Training will be\
    \ \ndeveloped.  \n \n2.8    These aspects constitute the essentials of the new\
    \ National Mineral Policy, 2008. A more \ndetailed approach towards putting these\
    \ essentials into practice and details of other associated \nfeatures of the Policy\
    \ are spelt out in the following paragraphs.  \n \n3.   REGULATION OF MINERALS\
    \  \n \n 3.1.   Management of mineral  resources is the  responsibility  of both\
    \ the  Central  Government  \nand  the  State  Governments  in   terms of  Entry\
    \  54  of the  Union List (List I) and  Entry  23  \nof  the State   List   (List\
    \ II)  of  the  Seventh   Schedule of the Constitution  of  India.   The  \nMines\
    \   and  Minerals ( Development and Regulation)  Act,  1957  (MMDR Act) , lays\
    \  down  the  \nlegal   frame -work for  the  regulation  of mines and  development\
    \  of  all  minerals other    than   \npetroleum   and   natural   gas.  The \
    \ Central Government   has  framed  the  Mineral  Concession   \nRules , 1960\
    \  (MCR)  for   regulating grant  of  reconnaissance permits  (RP) , prospecting\
    \   licences  \n(PL)   and   mining leases  (ML)    in   respect of all minerals\
    \ other than   atomic minerals   and  \nminor  minerals.   The State   Governments\
    \   have framed the rules in regard to minor minerals . \nThe Central Government\
    \   have also framed the Mineral   Conservation   and Development   \nRules, 1988\
    \  (MCDR),  for   conservation   and   systematic development   of   minerals.\
    \    These \nare   applicable   to   all minerals except coal, atomic minerals\
    \ and  minor minerals      \n \n3.2.   The   Central   Government in consultation\
    \ with State Governments shall formulate  the  \nlegal  measures necessary for\
    \ giving effect to the  new National Mineral Policy, 2008 ,  to    \nensure  \
    \  basic    uniformity    in     mineral  administration across the country  and\
    \   to   ensure   \nthat   the   development   of  mineral  resources  keeps \
    \ pace, and is  in  consonance  with  the  national   policy   goals.  The MMDR\
    \ Act, t he MCR and the MCDR will be amended in line with \nthe policy.  The \
    \  regulation   of   mines    and  development   of   mineral  resources  in \
    \ \naccordance   with   the  national   goals  and  priorities as spelt out in\
    \ the policy and the legal \nframework  shal l  be  the   responsibility  of both\
    \ the Central and the State Governments.  \n \n3.3 In order to make the regulatory\
    \ environment conducive to private investment the \nprocedures for grant of mineral\
    \ concessions of all types, such as Reconnaissance Permits, \nProsp ecting Licenses\
    \ and Mining Leases, shall be transparent and seamless and security of \ntenure\
    \ shall be guaranteed to the concessionaries. The first -in-time principle in\
    \ the case of sole \napplicants and the selection criteria in the case of multiple\
    \ applicants  will be appropriately \nelaborated. Prospecting and mining shall\
    \ be recognized as independent activities with \ntransferability of concessions\
    \ playing a key role in mineral sector development.  \n \n4.     ROLE OF THE STATE\
    \ IN MINERAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \nThe  role to be played by the Central and State\
    \ Governments in  regard  to  mineral  development  \nhas  been  extensively \
    \ dealt in  the  Mines  and Minerals (Development and Regulation)  Act, \n1957\
    \  and Rules  made under the Act by  the  Central  Government and  the  State\
    \   Governments \nin their  respective  domains.   The provisions  of  the  Act\
    \  and the Rules  will  be  reviewed  and  \nharmonised  with  the basic features\
    \ of the new N ational Mineral Policy .  In fu ture the core \nfunctions of the\
    \ S tate in mining will be facil itation and regulation of exploration and mining\
    \ \nactivities of investors and entrepreneurs, provision of infrastructure and\
    \ tax collection.  In mining \nactivities, there shall be arms length distance\
    \  between State agencies (P ublic Sector \nUndertakings ) that mine and those\
    \ that regulate.  There shall be transparency and fair play in the \nreservation\
    \  of ore bodies to State agencies on such areas where private players are not\
    \ holding or \nhave not applied for exploration or mining, unless security considerations\
    \ or  specific public \ninterests are involved.  \n \n5.         SURVEY AND EXPLORATION\
    \  \n \n5.1.   The Geological Survey of India is the principal agency for geological\
    \ mapping and    \nregional    mineral     resources assessment of the country.\
    \    It shall  be  responsib le  for  drawing  \nup  action oriented plans towards\
    \ these ends in close cooperation with  all  other  agencies  \nengaged in  this\
    \  task.  Detailed exploration   on   land   is   done   by   the Mineral Exploration\
    \ \nCorporation, Directorates   of Mining and G eology of the State Governments\
    \ and various Central \nand   State   Public Sector Organisations. In conducting\
    \ exploration for minerals special attention \nwill be given by these government\
    \ agencies to the development of strategic minerals through \nsystematic i nvestigation\
    \ of potential sources which are difficult to otherwise access.  \n 5.2     While\
    \ these Government agencies will continue to perform the tasks assigned to them\
    \ for \nexploration and survey, the private sector would in future be the main\
    \ source of inv estment in  \nreconnaissance and exploration and government agencies\
    \ will expend public funds primarily in \nareas where private sector investments\
    \ are not forthcoming despite the desirability of \nprogrammes due to reasons\
    \ such as high uncertainties. To expedite  completion of reconnaissance \nwork\
    \ for the entire country as early as possible an open sky policy of non -exclusivity\
    \ for \nreconnaissance work will be adopted. At the same time to attract large\
    \ investments and high \ntechnology a new instrument to be known as Large Area\
    \ Prospecting License will be introduced. \nHowever such bulk minerals which do\
    \ not need risk investment and high technology will not be \neligible for Large\
    \ Area Prospecting License. The durations of all concessions will be rationalised\
    \ \nand areas of operations enlarged suitably within each state.   \n \n5.3  \
    \   It is necessary to ensure that India’s exclusive economic zone is explored\
    \ and exploited to \nthe maximum possible extent. The Ministry of Earth Sciences\
    \ (MoES)  and its agencies    are \nentrusted with  the task of sea -bed exploration\
    \ and mining.  Cooperation between MoES  and GSI \nwill be institutionalised so\
    \ as to achieve this objective within a time bound framework. The task \nof mapping\
    \ out the extended economic zone will be expedited and completed withi n the time\
    \ \nprescribed by the International Sea Convention so that no area of sea bed\
    \ mining is lost to the \ncountry.  \n \n5.4     Particular  attention  will be\
    \ given  to  the  survey  and  exploration  of  minerals  in  which  \nthe  country\
    \  has a poor resource -cum-reserve  base despite having the geological potential\
    \ for \nlarge resources. Minerals for which there is demand within the country\
    \ either for use or for \nexport after processing will be prioritised.  Exploration\
    \ for lower grade hematite, magnetite, base \nmetals, noble metals, diamonds and\
    \ high grade Ilmenite will be put on the fast track.   \n \n5.5      Coordination\
    \ of the regional exploration work by government agencies is at  present  \nbeing\
    \  done   by  the  Central  Programming  Board  of  the Geological  S urvey  of\
    \  India.  The \ndisaggregated projects are generally discussed in the State Level\
    \ Committees and other technical \nforums before being incorporated into the annual\
    \ programme. The existing arrangement shall be \nrevamped to ensure that projects\
    \ and progr ammes are prioritised in line with the national policy \ngoals and\
    \ are chalked out after taking into account the exploration work undertaken by\
    \ the \nprivate sector.  \n \n6. DATA BASE OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND TENEMENTS\
    \  \n \n6.1.    The national inventory of mineral re sources will be based on\
    \ a comprehensive and up to \ndate review of exploration data. In coordination\
    \ with Geological Survey of India, the Indian \nBureau of Mines will maintain\
    \ a database in digitised form comprising both a Resource \nInventory and a Tenement\
    \ R egistry. The resource inventory will be in accordance with the latest version\
    \ of the UNFC system showing reserves and remaining resources as well in the traditional\
    \ \nIBM form of resources and probable and proven reserves.  The Tenement Registry\
    \ will give \ninformation of both Leasehold Areas as well as Freehold Areas in\
    \ terms of green field, brown \nfield and relinquished areas including areas given\
    \ up by the GSI and other RP/PL holders as not \npursued. The data would be maintained\
    \ online giving instant informati on to prospective investors \non what is available\
    \ for reconnaissance, prospecting and mining. Summaries of work done by \npublic\
    \ agencies will be kept in the form of meta -data in the public domain and detailed\
    \ reports \nwill be made available to interested inve stors on cost recovery basis.\
    \  \n \n6.2     Data filing requirements will be rigorously applied and all concession\
    \ holders will be \nsubjected to detailed moni toring in this regard. The lock\
    \ -in arrangements will be assured and \nreleased data will be integrated with\
    \ the data generated by the state agencies and made available \nto other prospectors.\
    \  \n \n7.     STRATEGY OF MINERAL DEVELOPMENT  \n7.1 General Strategy  \n \n\
    The  Strategy  for  development  of  any  mineral  should naturally  keep  in\
    \  view its ultimate  \nend  uses in terms of demand and supply in the short,\
    \ medium and long terms.   The  guiding \nprinciple  in  the  strategy of development\
    \  of  any  mineral  or mineral   deposit  at  any  location  \nshall  ordinarily\
    \  be  the economic cost of recovery i.e extraction cost relative to market price\
    \ and \nwill hence be determined by the market. However, a disaggregated approach\
    \ in respect of each \nmineral will be adopted  and a mineral specific strategy\
    \ will be developed. To maximise gains \nfrom the comparative advantage which\
    \ the country enjoys intra se  mineral development will be \nprioritised in terms\
    \ of import substitution, value addition and export, in that order.  \n \n7.2.\
    \   Conservation and Mineral Development  \n \nConservation  of minerals shall\
    \ be construed not  in  the restrictive    sense   of   abstinence   \nfrom  \
    \ consumption    or preservation   for  use in the distant future  but  as  a\
    \   positive   concept \nleading to au gmentation of  reserve base  through improvement\
    \ in  mining methods,  \nbeneficiation  and  utilisation of   low   grade  ore\
    \  and  rejects and   recovery  of associated \nminerals.   There shall be an\
    \ adequate and effective legal and institutional framework mandating \nzero-waste\
    \ mining as the ultimate goal and a commitment to prevent sub -optimal and \n\
    unscientific mining. Non -adherence to the Mining Plan based on these parameters\
    \ will carry \nrepercussions. Mineral sectoral value addition through latest techniques\
    \ o f beneficiation, \ncalibration, blending, sizing, concentration, pelletisation,\
    \ purification and general customisation \nof product will be encouraged. This\
    \ is particularly important in iron ore mining as about 80% of \nthe iron ore\
    \ produced in the country is in  the form of Fines and to promote such value addition\
    \ \nfiscal and non fiscal incentives will be considered. A thrust will be given\
    \ to exploitation of mineral resources in which the country is well endowed so\
    \ that the needs of domestic industry \nare fully met  keeping in mind both present\
    \ and future needs, while at the same time exploiting \nthe external markets for\
    \ such minerals.  \n \n7.3   Scientific Methods of Mining  \n \nMine  development\
    \ and mineral conservation as governed  by the   rules   and  regulations  will\
    \  \nbe  on   sound   scientific basis, with the regulatory agencies, viz. IBM\
    \ and the State Directorates, \nclosely  interacting with R&D organisation,  and\
    \ scientific  and  professional   bodies to ensure \noptimal Mining Plans. Conditions\
    \  of  mining  leases  re garding   size,  shape, disposition   with   \nreference\
    \  to  geological   boundaries   and other   mining  conditions  shall  be  such\
    \  as   to   \nfavourably predispose   the   leased  areas  to  systematic   and\
    \   complete extraction of minerals. \nThe regula tory agencies, namely the India\
    \ n Bureau of Mines and the State Directorates will be \nsuitably strengthened\
    \ through capacity building measures.  \n \n7.4   Mining as an Industry with Linkages\
    \  \n \nMining contributes to the generation of wealth and creation of employm\
    \ ent independently and \nshould therefore be treated as an economic activity\
    \ in its own right and not merely as an ancillary \nactivity of manufacturing\
    \ industry.  Domestic processing industry receives supplies of mineral \nresources\
    \ produced by the mining indust ry at market prices prevailing from time to time.\
    \  In \norder to be assured of uninterrupted supply of the mineral raw material\
    \ from domestic sources \nthe user industry will be encouraged to develop long\
    \ -term linkages with the mineral producing \nunits includin g equity participation\
    \ in such mining companies .  The mineral  processing  unit \nshould  not  only\
    \  get  an assured  supply  of  the  mineral  raw material   but   should   also\
    \  have   \nclose   links   with   the production  and  marketing  agencies of\
    \  the   mineral  based  end \nproducts. Mining as a backward linkage and Value\
    \ addition within the same state as a forward \nlinkage will, therefore, be encouraged.\
    \  \n \n7.5   Mining Equipment and Machinery  \n \nIndigenous industry for manufacture\
    \ of mining equipment and ma chinery shall be strengthened. \nInduction of foreign\
    \ technology and participation for this purpose will be encouraged. Use of \n\
    equipment and machinery which improve the efficiency, productivity and economics\
    \ of mining \noperations and safety and health of pers ons working in the mines\
    \ and surrounding areas shall be \nencouraged. Import of such equipment and machinery\
    \ shall be freely allowed.  \n \n \n \n 7.6.   Manpower Development  \nExisting\
    \  facilities  for basic and  specialised  training  shall be constantly  reviewed\
    \ and \nupgraded from  time  to  time  to  ensure  that  adequately trained manpower\
    \ at  all  levels  is  \navailable   for   the   development   of   mines   and\
    \   mineral s.  \n \nIn  order to improve the competitive edge of the  national\
    \ mining  industry,  emphasis  shall  be  \nlaid  on   mechanisation, computerisation\
    \   and   automation  of  the  existing   and   new mining  \nunits.   The man\
    \ power development programme shall b e suitably reoriented for the purpose. \
    \ \n \nAs the mining sector takes off, the country will need more and more mining\
    \ engineers, \ngeologists, geo -physicists, geo -chemists and geo -instrumentation\
    \ specialists. A comprehensive \nreview of the sector’s man power ne eds will\
    \ be undertaken and educational institutions will be \ngeared to meeting these\
    \ needs in the medium and long term.  \n \n7.7. Infrastructure Development  \n\
    \ \nMineral deposits generally occur in remote and backward areas with poor infrastructural\
    \   \nfacilities   which   often inhibit   their optimum development. A major\
    \ thrust needs   to   be   \ngiven to development of infrastructural facilities\
    \ in mineral bearing areas with special emphasis \non Linking Infrastructure.\
    \ Financial resources available with government w ill be leveraged to the \nmaximum\
    \ extent possible through recourse to user charge based public -private -partnership\
    \ \narrangements wherever possible by providing an institutional framework. An\
    \ enabling \nenvironment will be created to motivate large capacity mini ng companies\
    \ to undertake \nconstruction of transportation net works (road and rail) on their\
    \ own.  \n \nThe contribution of mineral development to regional and more specifically\
    \ peripheral \ndevelopment, commensurate with the huge investment in large mining\
    \ projec ts, is substantial.  In \nso far as public funding of infrastructure\
    \ is concerned a  much greater thrust will be given to \ndevelopment of health,\
    \ education, drinking water, road and other related facilities and \ninfrastructure\
    \ in mineral bearing areas so that an integrated approach emerges, encompassing\
    \ \nmineral development, regional development and the social and economic well\
    \ being of  the local, \nand particularly, tribal population.  \n \n \n7.8 Financial\
    \ Support for Mining   \nMining is an eligible activity for obtaining f inancial\
    \ support    from   financial   institutions.    \nHowever, at present   only\
    \ those mining projects   which   have a substantial   component   of   \nmining\
    \ machinery,   equipment   and buildings   are being financed. Steps  shall  be\
    \  taken  to  \nfacili tate   financing  of  mine development  and  also  of exploration\
    \  integral  to  the  mining \nproject.   \nProspecting being a high risk venture,\
    \ access to “risk funds” from capital markets and venture \nfunds will be facilitated.\
    \ Early stage Exploration and Min ing companies will be encouraged and \ndifferential\
    \ listing requirements through segmented exchanges will be explored. Induction\
    \ of \nforeign technology and foreign participation in exploration and mining\
    \ for high   value   and   \nscarce minerals   shall be pur sued.   Foreign equity\
    \ investment in joint ventures for exploration \nand mining promoted by Indian\
    \ Companies will be encouraged.    \n \n7.9 Small Deposits  \n \nSmall and isolated\
    \ deposits of minerals are scattered all over the country. These often lend \n\
    themselves to e conomic exploitation   through   small   scale mining. With modest\
    \ demand on \ncapital expenditure and short lead -time, they provide employment\
    \ opportunities for the local \npopulation. However, due to diseconomies of scale\
    \ they can also lead to sub -optimal mi ning and \necological disturbance. Efforts\
    \ will be  made to promote small scale mining of  small  deposits  \nin  a  scientific\
    \ and efficient manner while safeguarding  vital environmental and ecological\
    \   \nimperatives. Regulation of these conditionalities will  be tightened so\
    \ as to control and prevent \nthe growth of illegal mining    \n \nWhere small\
    \ deposits are not susceptible to viable mining a cluster approach will be adopted\
    \ by \ngranting the deposits together as a single lease within a geographically\
    \ defined bou ndary. Efforts \nwould be made to grant such mineral concessions\
    \ to consortia of small scale miners so that such \nclusters of small deposits\
    \ will enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale.  \n \nIn grant\
    \ of   mineral concessions for small deposits in Scheduled Areas, preference shall\
    \ be given \nto Scheduled Tribes singly or as cooperatives.  \n \n \n7.10. Mineral\
    \ Development & Protection of Environment  \n \nExtraction  of  minerals closely\
    \ impacts  other  nat ural  resources  like  land,  water, air  and  \nforest.\
    \   The  areas  in  which  minerals  occur  often have  other  resources  presenting\
    \ a  choice  \nof  utilisation  of the   resources.   Some such areas are ecologically\
    \   fragile and some are \nbiologically  rich.   It  is  necessary  to  take a\
    \ comprehensive   view  to  facilitate  the  choice  or  \norder   of land  use\
    \  keeping  in  view the needs  of  development  as  well as   needs   of   \n\
    protecting   the   forests,   environment   and ecology.   Both  as pects  have\
    \  to  be  properly  \ncoordinated  to facilitate  and  ensure  a  sustainable\
    \  development  of  mineral resources in \nharmony with environment.  \n Mining\
    \ activity often leads to environmental problems like land  degradation in  opencast\
    \ mining \nand  la nd subsidence  in underground  mining, deforestation, atmospheric\
    \   pollution,   pollution  \nof  rivers   and   streams, soil erosion due disposal\
    \   of  solid  wastes like overburden and so on, \nall  affecting   the   ecological\
    \ balance  of  the  area.  Open -cast mining in areas with actual forest   \n\
    cover   leads   to   deforestation.    Prevention    and mitigation  of  adverse\
    \  environmental  \neffects  due  to   mining  of  minerals  and  repairing  and\
    \   re -vegetation of the affected forest \narea and land co vered by trees in\
    \ accordance with the latest internationally acceptable norms and \nmodern afforestation\
    \ practices  shall form integral part of mine development  strategy in every \n\
    instance.  All mining shall be undertaken within the parameters of a comprehen\
    \ sive Sustainable \nDevelopment Framework which will be so devised as to take\
    \ all these aspects into consideration. \nThe guiding principle shall be that\
    \ a miner shall leave the mining area in better ecological shape \nthan he found\
    \ it.  \n \nMining operations shall n ot ordinarily be taken up in identified\
    \    ecologically   fragile   and   \nbiologically    rich areas.    Strip  mining\
    \  in  forest  areas  should    be  avoided  and  it  should  \nbe  permitted\
    \  only  when accompanied    with    comprehensive    time -bound    reclamation\
    \ \nprogramme.  \n \nNo mining lease would be granted to any party, private or\
    \ public,   without   a   proper   mining   \nplan   including the environmental\
    \ management plan approved and enforced by statutory   \nauthorities. The  environmental\
    \   manage ment   plan should  adequately  provide  for  controlling  \nthe  environmental\
    \ damage, restoration  of  mined  areas  and  for   planting   of trees   according\
    \   \nto   the  prescribed  norms. As   far   as possible, reclamation   and \
    \  afforestation    will     proceed \nconcurrently with mineral extraction. \
    \ \n \nEfforts would be made to convert old disused mining sites into forests\
    \ and other appropriate \nforms of land use.  \n \n7.11 Relief & Rehabilitation\
    \ of Displaced and Affected Persons  \n \nMining operations often  involve acquisition\
    \ of land held by individuals including those \nbelonging to the weaker sections.\
    \ In all such cases a social impact assessment will be undertaken \nto ensure\
    \ that suitable Relief and Rehabilitation packages are evolved. While compensation\
    \ is  \ngenerally paid to the owner for his acquired land, rehabilitation of affected\
    \ persons in the form of \nsubstitute land, land for housing and jobs is not always\
    \ adequate. Appropriate compensation will \nform an important aspect of the Sustainable\
    \ Development F ramework mentioned in para 2.3 and \n7.10 above. In so far as\
    \ indigenous (tribal)  populations are concerned the Framework shall \nincorporate\
    \ models of stakeholder interest for them in the mining operation, especially\
    \  in \nsituations where  the  weaker  sectio ns  like the local tribal populations\
    \ are likely  to  be  \ndeprived  of  their  means  of  livelihood  as  a result\
    \ of the mining intervention.  In areas in which minerals occur and which are\
    \ inhabited by tribal communities and weaker \nsections it is imperat ive to recognize\
    \ resettlement and rehabilitation issues as intrinsic to the \ndevelopment process\
    \ of the affected zone.  Thus all measures proposed to be taken will be \nformulated\
    \ with the active participation of the affected persons, rather than externally\
    \ i mposed.  \nA careful assessment of the economic, environmental and social\
    \ impact on the affected persons \nwill be made.  A mechanism will be evolved\
    \ which would actually improve the living standards \nof the affected population\
    \ and ensure for them a sustainable  income above the poverty line.  For \nthis\
    \ purpose, all the provisions of the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement\
    \ Policy or any \nrevised Policy or Statute that may come into operation, will\
    \ be followed.  \n  \n7.12 Mine Closures  \n \nOnce the  process  of  econo mical\
    \  extraction  of  a mine is  complete  there  is  need  for \nscientific mine\
    \  closure which will not only restore ecology and regenerate bio mass but also\
    \ take \ninto account the socio -economic aspects of such closure.  Where mining\
    \   activities  have  b een  \nspread  over a few decades,  mining  communities\
    \  get  established  and  closure  of the mine \nmeans  not  only  loss  of  jobs\
    \  but  also  disruption of  community  life.   Whenever  mine  \nclosure   becomes\
    \   necessary,   it   should   be   orderly   and  systematic  and  so  planned\
    \  as to  \nhelp  the  workers  and  the  dependent   community  rehabilitate\
    \  themselves   without   undue  \nhardship.  \n \n7.13. Mine Safety  \n \nMining\
    \ operations are hazardous in nature.   Accidents  happen  and  often  result\
    \  in  the  loss  of  \nlife  or  limb  of  persons  engaged  in  it.   Efforts\
    \  must  be  directed   towards  the  development  \nand  adoption of  mining\
    \  methods  which  would  increase  the  safety  of  workers  and  reduce  \n\
    the   accidents.  Towards   this end, participation and cooperation   of   mine\
    \ workers   shall be \nsecured.   Steps  will  also  be  taken   to  minimise\
    \   the  adverse  impact  of  mining  on  the  \nhealth   of  workers and the\
    \ surrounding population.  \n \n8.     FOREIGN TRADE  \n \nMinerals continue to\
    \ be an important source of foreign exchange earnings.   The  policy of export\
    \ \nshall  keep  in  view  the dynamics of  mineral  inventories as well as the\
    \ short, medium  and long  \nterm  needs  of  the  country.   Efforts  shall \
    \ be made  to  export  minerals  in  value  added  form  \nas  far as  possible.\
    \      The  indigenous   mineral  industry   shall  be  attuned  to  the   \n\
    international   economic  situation  in  order   to derive maximum  advantage\
    \  from  foreign  trade   \nby   carefully   anticipating   technology   and \
    \  demand  changes   in   the   international  market   \nfor   minerals.  \n\
    \ The import of mineral based material shall be coordinated as   far   as possibl\
    \ e with the \nindigenous   development   of mineral   based   industries.   \
    \ Areas   of   cooperation    with \ncountries    with   complementary   resource\
    \   base   shall    be developed for mutual advantage.   \nThe approach   shall\
    \ be to make available mineral  based materials to domestic users at \nreasonable\
    \ prices as determined by market forces.  \n \nA long term export policy would\
    \ provide stability and prove to be an incentive for investing in \nlarge scale\
    \ commercial mining activity.  To develop mining as a modern stand alone industry\
    \ \nsubstantial investment is required. Assurances on export of minerals will\
    \ be a key factor for \ninvestment decisions particularly on FDI in the sector.\
    \  The Export Policy should be based on a \nclear long term strategy for export\
    \ of minera ls taking these aspects into consideration.  \n \n9.     FISCAL ASPECTS\
    \  \n \nIt will be the endeavour of government, within the context of the budget,\
    \ to design fiscal \nmeasures conducive to the promotion of mineral exploration\
    \ and development including \nbeneficiatio n and other forms of product refinement.\
    \  In the context of the   changing mineral \nscenario and the economies of mineral\
    \ development and products, both at the national and \ninternational level fiscal\
    \ changes will be examined from time to time consistent wit h the general \ntax\
    \ structure and through the normal budgetary process.  Mineral prices should reflect\
    \ their value \nand the royalty structures will be designed to ensure that the\
    \ producer earns and the consumer \npays the true value of the minerals produced\
    \ and  consumed. The fiscal dispensation will \ngenerally aim to ensure that adequate\
    \ compensation is forthcoming to the state in return for the \nconcessions it\
    \ grants.  \n \n10. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  \n \n10.1. General Approach   \n\
    \ \nResearch  and development in the mineral  sector  has  to cover  the  entire\
    \  gamut of  activities  \nfrom  geological survey, exploration, mining, beneficiation,\
    \ concentration  of minerals  to \ndevelopment of materials.  Efforts  will  be\
    \  directed towards  the  development  of  new \ntechnologies   for  conv ersion\
    \  of  existing  mineral   resources into   viable  economic  resources.    \n\
    Appropriate   technologies shall   be   developed  to  enable   indigenous   industries\
    \   to utilise   \nthe  mineral  resources  with  which  the  country   is abundantly\
    \   end owed  and  as  substitutes  \nfor  minerals   whose reserves  are  poor.\
    \   R&D efforts shall be directed to find new   and \nalternative uses for minerals\
    \   whose   traditional demand is on the wane. Indigenous technology \nhas to\
    \ be upgraded through research an d   appropriate absorption and adoption   of\
    \   \ntechnological innovations abroad.   Research  and  development  efforts\
    \  shall be  made  to  \nimprove  efficiency  in  process,  operations   and also\
    \    the   recovery   of   by -products   and   reduction    i n specification\
    \  and  consumption  norms.   Efforts will also   be directed to evolve \nlow\
    \ capital and energy saving processing systems.  \n \n10.2. Research in Mining\
    \ Methods  \n \nMining methods determine the safety, economy, speed and the percentage\
    \ of extraction of the \nore reserves from a mine. Research and development thrust\
    \ shall be directed specially in the \nareas of rock mechanics, ground control,\
    \ mine   design engineering, equ ipment   deployment   \nand maintenance,   energy\
    \ conservation, environmental protection, safety of operations and \nhuman engineering.\
    \  \n \n10.3   Mineral Processing and Beneficiation  \n \nAttention will be given\
    \ to beneficiation and agglomeration techniques to brin g lower grades and \n\
    finer size   material into use. Research  organisations,  including the  National\
    \  Mineral \nProcessing   Laboratories   of  the  Indian   Bureau   of   Mines\
    \ will be   strengthened  for  \ndevelopment  of   processes   for beneficiation\
    \   a nd  mineral  and  elemental  analysis  of   ores \nand   ore   dressing\
    \  products.   There shall   be   cooperation between and coordination among all\
    \ \norganisations in public and private sector engaged in this task. Research\
    \  and  development  shall \nbe  orie nted  to  ensure maximum   economic  recovery\
    \  of  the  associated  minerals   and \nvaluable metals.  \n \n10.4 Development\
    \ Of Automated Equipment  \n \nTo  meet the objective of safety and  economic\
    \  production attention   will  be  given  to  the  \ndevelopment  of   robotics,\
    \ automated  equipment  and  system  for  mining,  especially   for deep \nmining\
    \ and transportation to surface.  \n \n10.5.  Deep Sea Mining  \n \nIndia is a\
    \ pioneer investor and has been allocated a mine site   of   150,000 square kilometres\
    \ in \nIndian   O cean   for exclusive   survey   and exploration.   Deep   ocean\
    \   resources represent an \nexceptionally large and potentially   important mineral\
    \   resource.    Integrated   systems   for    \nexploration, exploitation,  \
    \ mining   and processing   of   these   resources shall   be   expedited \nwith\
    \   the   development/acquisition   of necessary     technologies.     Appropriate\
    \     mechanism     \nfor coordinating   the survey and exploration of Deep Sea\
    \   Bed Area    will   be established by \nthe   Ministry of Ea rth Sciences .\
    \  \n \n \n 10.6  Production Of Materials Of High Purity  \n \nResearch  will\
    \ be directed towards raw materials  required  for   production  of  materials\
    \  of  \nhigh  purity  for   use   in  advanced   technology  applications  such\
    \   as   semi -conductors,   \nphoto -voltaic,   lasers,  special  sensors,  \
    \ high   temperature  new    ceramics,   hard   and   high    \ntemperature  \
    \  materials,  superconductors,   insulators,  very  thin  films,  glasses   and\
    \  liquid \ncrystals and metal and mineral fibres.  \n \n10.7.  Coordination Of\
    \ Research Organisations  \n \nResearch and development activities in the mineral\
    \  sector are  carried  out  in  the  national  \nlaboratories,   educational\
    \ institutions   and  R&D  units  of  public  and  private   sector \nenterprises.\
    \   Pooling  of  resources  and  expertise   available in  the  various  R&D \n\
    Organisations is  imperative  to  meet  the challenges  and  to  fulfil  the \
    \ tasks  ahead  in  the   \nmineral sector.    Linkages   and   interaction  \
    \ between   the   various institutions  en gaged  in  \nR&D in the  mineral  sector\
    \  shall  be strengthened  to  derive  the maximum  benefit.   \nInterchange of\
    \ scientists   between   institutions shall   be   encouraged   to accelerate\
    \ the pace of \ninteraction. It shall also be ensured that the resear ch findings\
    \ are made available to users \nexpeditiously. There shall   be   cooperation\
    \ between and coordination among all organisations in \nthe public and private\
    \ sectors engaged in this task.  \n \nMining methods determine the safety, economy,\
    \ speed and the per centage of extraction of the \nore reserves from a mine. Research\
    \ and development thrust needs to be  directed in areas of such \nas rock mechanics,\
    \ ground  control, mine design engineering, equipment deployment and \nmaintenance,\
    \ energy conservation, environmen tal protection, safety of  operations and human\
    \ \nengineering. This has to be done in a holistic way so that inter -linkages\
    \ are established to the \nadvantage of each segment. To this end the diverse\
    \ research, development and training initiatives \nwithin the pu blic domain shall\
    \ be reorganised into a single and cohesive R & D and Training \ninstitution of\
    \ excellence to be known as the National Institute of Mineral Development. \n\
    Organizations such as the  National  Mineral Processing   Laboratories of the\
    \ Indian Bure au of \nMines, the National Institute of Rock mechanics, the Jawaharlal\
    \ National Institute of Aluminium \nResearch and Development, the R & D initiatives\
    \ of the Geological Survey of India will be \njoined to provide a collective thrust.\
    \  \n \n11.    CONCLUSIONS  \n \nMineral wealth, though finite and non -renewable\
    \ in the long term, is a major resource for \ndevelopment.   The  need for a well\
    \ planned programme of survey and exploration, management  \nof  resources which\
    \ have already been discovered and those which are in t he process of \ndiscovery\
    \  and  their optimal, economical and timely use are  matters  of national  importance.\
    \   The success of the second national mineral policy will depend largely on a\
    \ national consensus   \nto fulfil its underlying principles and objectiv es.\
