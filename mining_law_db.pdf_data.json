UNFC classification of reserves : - \n \nA.    DEFINITION OF TERMS AND CODES ON RESERVES AND RESOURCES  \nUNDER  UNIT ED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CLASSIFICATION (UNFC) OF \nMINERAL RESOURCES  \n \n \n  The UNFC consists of a three dimensional system with the following three axes: \nGeological Assessment, Feasibility Assessment and Economic viability.  The process of \ngeological assessment i s generally conducted in stages of increasing details.  The typical \nsuccessive stages of geological investigation i.e. reconnaissance, prospecting, general \nexploration and detailed exploration, generate resource data with a clearly defined degrees of \ngeolo gical assurance. These four stages are therefore used as geological assessment categories in \nthe classification.  Feasibility assessment studies form an essential part of the process of \nassessing a mining project. The typical successive stages of feasibili ty assessment i.e. geological \nstudy as initial stage followed by prefeasibility study and feasibility study/mining report are well \ndefined.  The degree of economic viability (economic or subeconomic) is assessed in the course \nof prefeasibility and feasibil ity studies.  A prefeasibility study provides a preliminary assessment \nwith a lower level of accuracy than that of a feasibility study, by which economic viability is \nassessed in detail.  \n \n  It is a three digit code based system, the economic viability axis  representing the \nfirst digit, the feasibility axis the second digit and the geologic axis the third digit.  The three \ncategories of economic viability have codes 1,2 and 3 in decreasing order, similarly the three \ncategories of feasibility study have also codes 1,2 and 3 while the four stages of geological \nassessment are represented by 4 codes i.e. 1 (detailed exploration), 2 (general exploration), 3 \n(prospecting) and 4 (reconnaissance).  Thus the highest category of resources under UNFC \nsystem will have th e code (111) and lowest category the code (334).  The various terms used in \nthis classification and their definitions are as follows:  \n \n1. Total Mineral Resource  \n- A concentration (or occurrence) of material of intrinsic economic interest.  \n- Reasonable prospec ts for eventual economic extraction.  \n- Location, grade, quantity, geological characteristic known, estimated or interpreted    \n  from specific geological evidence and knowledge.  \n \n(i) Measured Mineral Resource (331)  \n- That part of mineral resource for which ton nage, densities, shape, physical       \ncharacteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of  \nconfidence i.e. based on detailed exploration.  \n \n \n \n 170 \n \n(ii) Indicated Mineral Resource (332)  \n- Tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristi c, grade and mineral content can be   \nestimated with reasonable level of confidence based on exploration, sampling and  \ntesting information, location of borehole, pits etc. too widely spaced.  \n \n(iii) Inferred Mineral Resource (333)  \n- Tonnage, grade and mineral c ontent can be estimated with low level of confidence.   \n   Inferred from geological evidence.  \n \n2. Mineral Reserve  \n- Economically mineable part of measured and/or indicated mineral resource.  \n(i) Proved Mineral Reserves (111)  \n- Economically mineable part of Measure d Mineral Resource.  \n(ii) Probable Mineral Reserves (121 & 122)  \n- Economically mineable part of indicated or in some cases a measured mineral \nresource.  \n \n3. Reconnaissance Mineral Resource (334)  \n- Estimates based on regional geological studies and mapping, airborne a nd indirect     \n  Methods, preliminary field inspections as well as geological inference and extrapolation  \n \n4. Prefeasibility Mineral Resource (221 and 222)   \n- That part of an indicated and in some circumstances measured mineral resource that has   \n   been s hown by prefeasibility study to be not economically mineable.  \n-  Possibly economically viable subject to changes in technological, economic,   \n   environmental and/or other relevant condition.  \n \n5. Feasibility Mineral Resource (211)   \n- That part of measured m ineral resource, which after feasibility study has been found to   \n   be economically not mineable.  \n- Possibly economically viable subject to changes in technological, economic,  \n  environmental and/or other relevant condition.  \n \nDefinition of Uneconomic Oc currence  \n \n Materials of estimated quantity, that are too low in grade or for other reasons are not \nconsidered potentially economic.  Thus, Uneconomic Occurrence is not pat of a Mineral \nResource.  If quantity and quality are considered worthy of reporting, it should be recognized  \nthat an Uneconomic Occurrence cannot be exploited without major technological and/or \neconomic changes, which are not currently predictable.  \n \nMineral Occurrence:  \n \n A Mineral Occurrence is an indication of mineralisation, that is wor thy of further \ninvestigation.  The term Mineral Occurrence does not imply any measure of volume/tonnage or \ngrade/quality and is thus not part of a Mineral Resource.  171 \n \nB. Definitions of Terms to be used in  the United Nations International Framework   \nClassific ation for Reserves/Resources  \n \nSolid Fuels and Mineral Commodities – \n \nDefinitions of Stages of Feasibility Assessment  \n \nMining Report  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFeasibility Study  A Mining Report  is understood as the current documentation of the state of \ndevelopment and exp loitation of a deposit during its economic life including \ncurrent mining plans.  It is generally made by the operator of the mine.  The \nstudy takes into consideration the quantity and quality  of the minerals \nextracted during the reporting time, changes in  Economic Viability \ncategories due to changes in prices and costs, development of relevant \ntechnology, newly imposed environmental or other regulations, and data on \nexploration conducted concurrently with mining.  \n \nIt presents the current status of the dep osits, providing a detailed and \naccurate, up -to-date statement on the reserves and the remaining resources.  \n \nA Feasibility Study  assesses in detail the technical soundness and \nEconomic Viability of a mining project, and serves as the basis for the \ninvestme nt decision and as a bankable document for project financing.  The \nstudy constitutes an audit of all geological, engineering, environmental, \nlegal and economic information accumulated on the project.  Generally, a \nseparate environmental impact study is req uired.  \n \nCost data must be reasonably accurate (usually within  10%), and no \nfurther investigations should be necessary to make the investment decision.  \nThe information basis associated with this level of accuracy comprises the \nreserve figures based on th e results of Detailed Exploration, technological, \npilot tests and capital and operating cost calculations such as quotations of \nequipment suppliers.    \n \nA detailed list of the important items addressed in a Feasibility Study is \ngiven below :  \n \n 172 \n \n \nList of t he more important items to be addressed in a Feasibility Study  \n \nGeographical conditions  \n \nInfrastructure  \nÞ public utilities  \nÞ road, railways and other  \nÞ manpower  \n \nGeology  \nÞ structure, size, shape  \nÞ Mineral content, grade, density  \nÞ reserve/resource quantity  and \nquality  \nÞ other relevant geological features  \n \nLegal Matters  \nÞ Rights and ownership  \nÞ Socioeconomic impact studies  \nÞ Public acceptance  \nÞ Land requirements  \nÞ Government factors  Operating  \n \nÞ rock mechanics  \nÞ mining equipment  \nÞ mining method  \nÞ constructio n plan and schedule  \nÞ appropriate technological pilot tests  \nÞ mill and processing plant  \nÞ tailings disposal  \nÞ water management  \nÞ transportation  \nÞ power supply  \nÞ manpower/labour relations  \nÞ auxiliary facilities and services  \nÞ closure design  \n \nEnvironment (if not dealt  \nwith in a separate study)  \n \nMarket analysis  \n \nFinancial Analysis  \nÞ Capital cost  \nÞ Cashflow forecast  \nÞ Investment cost  \nÞ Inflation forecast  \nÞ Operating cost  \nÞ Sensitivity studies  \nÞ Closure cost  \nÞ Rehabilitation cost  \n \nRisk Assessment  \n \n \n \nA sensitivi ty study may require independent verification in certain circumstances.     173 \n \nDefinition of Stages of Feasibility Assessment (Contd.)  \n \n \nPrefeasibility \nStudy  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGeological \nStudy   A Prefeasibility Study  provides a preliminary assessment of the Economic \nViability of a deposit and forms the basis for justifying further investigations \n(Detailed Exploration and Feasibility Study).  It usually follows a successful \nexploration campaign, and summarizes all geological, engineering, \nenvironmental, legal and economic information accumulated to date on the \nproject.  \n \nIn projects that have reached a relatively advanced stage, the Prefeasibility \nStudy should have error limits of   25%.  In less advanced projects higher \nerrors are to be expected.  Various term s are in use internationally for \nPrefeasibility Studies reflecting the actual accuracy level.  The data required \nto achieve this level of accuracy are reserves/resources figures based on \nDetailed and General Exploration, technological tests at laboratory s cale and \ncost estimates e.g. from catalogues or based on comparable mining \noperations.  \n \nThe Prefeasibility Study addresses the items listed under the Feasibility Study, \nalthough not in as much details.  \n \nA Geological Study  is an initial evaluation of Econom ic Viability.  This is \nobtained by applying meaningful cut -off values for grade, thickness, depth \nand costs estimated from comparable mining operations.  \n \nEconomic Viability categories, however, cannot in general be defined from \nthe Geological Study because  of the lack of detail necessary for an Economic \nViability evaluation.  The resource quantities estimated may indicate that the \ndeposit is of intrinsic economic interest, i.e. in the range of economic to \npotentially economic.  \n \nA Geological Study is general ly carried out in the following four main stages: \nReconnaissance, Prospecting, General Exploration and Detailed Exploration \n(for definition of each stage see below).  The purpose of the Geological Study \nis to identify mineralization, to establish continuit y, quantity, and quality of a \nmineral deposit, and thereby define an investment opportunity.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 174 \n \nDefinitions of Stages of Geological Study  \n \nReconnaissance  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProspecting  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGeneral \nExploration  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDetailed \nExploration  \n A Reconnaissance  study identifies areas of enhanced mineral potential on a \nregional scale based primarily on results of regional geological studies, \nregional geological mapping, airborne and indirect methods, preliminary \nfield inspection, as well as geological inference a nd extrapolation. The \nobjective is to identify mineralised areas worthy of further investigation \ntowards deposit identification.  Estimates of quantities should only be made \nif sufficient data are available and when an analogy with known deposits of \nsimila r geological character is possible, and then only within an order of \nmagnitude.  \n \nProspecting  is the systematic process of searching for a mineral deposit by \nnarrowing down areas of promising enhanced mineral potential.  The \nmethods utilised are outcrop ide ntification, geological mapping, and indirect \nmethods such as geophysical and geochemical studies.  Limited trenching, \ndrilling, and sampling may be carried out.  The objective is to identify a \ndeposit which will be the target for further exploration.  Est imates of \nquantities are inferred, based on interpretation of geological, geophysical \nand geochemical results.  \n \nGeneral Exploration  involves the initial delineation of an identified \ndeposit.  Methods used include surface mapping, widely spaced sampling, \ntrenching and drilling for preliminary evaluation of mineral quantity and \nquality (including mineralogical tests on laboratory scale if required), and \nlimited interpolation based on indirect methods of investigation.  The \nobjectivce is to establish the main geological features of a deposit, giving a \nreasonable indication of continuity and providing an initial estimate of size, \nshape, structure and grade.  The degree of accuracy should be sufficient for \ndeciding whether a Prefeasibility Study and Detailed Expl oration are \nwarranted.  \n \nDetailed Exploration  involves the detailed three -dimensional delineation \nof a known deposit achieved through sampling, such as from outcrops, \ntrenches, boreholes, shafts and tunnels.  Sampling grids are closely spaced \nsuch that size , shape, structure, grade, and other relevant characteristics of \nthe deposit are established with a high degree of accuracy.  Processing tests \ninvolving bulk sampling may be required.  A decision whether to conduct a \nFeasibility Study can be made from the information provided by Detailed \nExploration.  \n \n \n \n 175 \n \nDefinition of Economic Viability Categories  \n \nEconomic  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNormal  \nEconomic  \n \n \nExceptional \nEconomic \n(Conditional \neconomic)  \n-----------------------  \n \nPotentially \nEconomic  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarginal \nEconomic  \n \n \nSubmar ginal \nEconomic  \n \n-----------------------  \nEconomic to \nPotentially \nEconomic \n(intrinsically \neconomic)  \n \n Quantities, reported in tonnes/volume with grade/quality, demonstrated by \nmeans of a Prefeasibility Study, Feasibility Study or Mining Report, in \norder of i ncreasing accuracy, that justify extraction under the technological, \neconomic, environmental and other relevant conditions, realistically \nassumed at the time of the determination.  \n \nThe term economic comprises both normal economic and exceptional \neconomic a s defined below.  These two subcategories are for optional use \non a national level.  \n \nNormal economic reserves are reserves that justify extraction under \ncompetitive market conditions.  Thus, the average value of the commodity \nmined per year must be such as  to satisfy the required return on investment.  \n \nExceptional (conditional) economic reserves are reserves which at present \nare not economic under competitive market conditions.  Their exploitation \nis made possible through government subsidies and/or other s upportive \nmeasurees.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n \nQuantities, reported in tonnes/volume with grade/quality, demonstrated by \nmeans of a Prefeasibility Study, Feasibility Study or Mining Report, in \norder of increasing accuracy, not justifying extraction under the \ntechnological economic, environmental and other relevant conditions, \nrealistically assumed at the time of the determination, but possibly  so in \nthe future.  \nThe term potentially economic comprises both marginal and submarginal \nas defined below.  These two subcategories are for optional use on a \nnational level.  \nMarginal economic resources are resources which at the time of \ndetermination are not economic, but border on being so.  They may \nbecome economic in the near future as a result of changes in technological, \neconomic, environmental and/or other relevant conditions.  \nSubmarginal economic resources are resources that would require a \nsubstantially higher commodity price or a major cost -reduc ing advance in \ntechnology to render them economic.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nQuantities, reported in tonnes/volume with grade/quality, estimated by \nmeans of a Geological Study to be of intrin sic economic interest.  Since the \nGeological Study includes only a preliminary evaluation of Economic \nViability, no distinction can be made between economic and potentially \neconomic1/.  These Resources are therefore said to lie in the range of \neconomic to potentially economic.  \n1/    Except in the case of low investment mineral commodities like sand, gravel and common clay, where \na distinction between economic and potential economic can be made.  176 \n \nC.

Just as these goals and perspectives are dyn amic and \nresponsive to the changing global economic scenario  so also the national mineral policy has \nto be dynamic taking into consideration the changing needs of industry in the context of the \ndomestic and gl obal economic environment. It is, therefore, necessary to revisit the National \nMineral Policy, 1993,  as provided in para 4 of the same, and to spell  out  in   a revised \nstatement  the  different  elements  of  policy,  includi ng elements newly evolved, for the  \ndevelopment   of   the mineral  resources of the country.   \n \n2. BASIC FEATURES  \n \n   2.1  The country is blessed with ample resources of a number of minerals and has the \ngeological environment for many others. To exploit the country’s geological potential it is \nimportant that scientific and detailed prospect ing is carried out in search of its mineral resources.  \nIt will be en sured that   regional and detailed exploration is carried out systematically in the \nentire geologically conducive mineral bearing area of the country using state -of-the-art \ntechniques in a time bound manner. Minerals being a valuable resource the extractio n of mineral \nresources located through exploration and prospecting has to be maximised through   scientific \nmethods   of mining, beneficiation and economic   util isation. Zero waste mining will be the \nnational goal and mining tech nology will be upgraded to ensure extraction and utilisation of the \nentire run -of-mines.  \n \n2.2   To achieve both these goals of large scale prospecting and optimal mining large \ninvestments will be required together with the latest technologies in prospecti ng and mining. \nThe regulatory environment will be improved to make it more conducive to investment and \ntechnology flows. Capital market structures will be developed to attract risk investment into \nsurvey and prospecting. Transparency in allocation of conce ssions will be assured. Preference \nmay be given to a value addition industry in grant of mineral concession. However, this will not in any way undermine the security of tenure to a holder of a concessionaire. The \ndevelopment of a proper inventory of resour ces and reserves, a mining tenement registry and a \nmineral atlas will be given priority.  Enforcement of mining   plans for adoption of proper   \nmining   methods   and optimum utilisation of minerals will be ensured. For these purposes the \nGeological Surve y of India  (GSI) , the India n Bureau of Mines  (IBM)  and the State Directorates \nof Mining & Geology will be strengthened with man power, equipment and skill sets upgraded \nto the level of state of the art.  \n \n2.3.      Mining is closely linke d with forestry and environment issues. A significant part of the \nnation’s known reserves of some important minerals are in areas which are under forest cover. \nFurther, mining activity is an intervention in the environment and has the potential to disturb \nthe ecological balance of an area. However, the needs of economic development make the \nextraction of the nation’s mineral resources an important priority.  A framework of sustainable \ndevelopment will be designed which takes care of bio diversity issues and  to ensure that \nmining activity takes place along with suitable measures for restoration of the ecological \nbalance. Special care will be taken to protect the interest of host and indigenous (tribal) \npopulations through developing models of stakeholder inte rest based on international best \npractice. Project affected persons will be protected through comprehensive relief and \nrehabilitation packages in line with the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement  Policy.  \n \n 2.4     As the country develops and industry  grows assured availability and proximity of \nmineral resources will play an important role in giving a competitive edge to Indian industry. \nThe multiplier effect of minerals processed into metals on downstream industrialisation cannot \nbe over emphasised. V alue addition will, therefore, be actively encouraged. However, such \nvalue addition will go hand in hand with the growth of the mineral sector as a stand alone \nindustrial activity. While, appropriate  linkages  between  exploitation  of   minerals and  the ir \nend use including the development  of industry based on the minerals will be established \nwherever feasible, a downward curve in an industrial sector using a particular mineral within \nthe country need not be allowed to effect the growth of mining activit y for that mineral. Hence \nemployment and tertiary sector spin offs from both value  addition as well as from mining will \nbe encouraged so as to maximise the contribution of the mineral sector to the country’s gross \ndomestic product.  \n \n2.5    Mining infrastru cture requires a special thrust as the economic efficiency of evacuation of    \nminerals from pit mouth to user point or port or rail head is closely linked to the end use value \nof the mineral and of the viability of the industry using the mineral.  Innovat ive structures will \nbe devised for developing and financing the infrastructure needs of the mining sector. While \nassistance through viability gap funding will be extended where required the principle of user \ncharges and Private Public Participation will be  the basis on which mining infrastructure will be \nbuilt.   2.6   India is a federal structure with a single economic space. Nevertheless, the legitimate fiscal \ninterests of States which are mineral rich need to be protected. The r evenues from minerals will \nbe rationalised to e nsure that the mineral bearing S tates get a fair share of the value of the \nminerals extracted from their grounds.  New sources of rev enue will be developed for the S tates \nand State agencies involved in mineral  sector development and regulation will be encouraged to \nmodernise in the areas of prospecting as well as regulation. The States will be assisted to \novercome the problem of illegal mining through operational and financial linkages with the \nIndia n Bureau of  Mines.  \n \n2.7       To enable the use of state of the art exploration techniques, scientific mining and optimal \nuse of minerals through ore dressing and beneficiation technologies it is necessary not only to \npromote research and development in minerals but to simultaneously establish appropriate \neducational and training facilities for human resources development to meet the manpower \nrequirements of the mineral industry.  These matters will receive prime importance and a \ncomp rehensive institution al framework for R esearch  & D evelopment,  and Training will be \ndeveloped.  \n \n2.8    These aspects constitute the essentials of the new National Mineral Policy, 2008. A more \ndetailed approach towards putting these essentials into practice and details of other associated \nfeatures of the Policy are spelt out in the following paragraphs.  \n \n3.   REGULATION OF MINERALS  \n \n 3.1.   Management of mineral  resources is the  responsibility  of both the  Central  Government  \nand  the  State  Governments  in   terms of  Entry  54  of the  Union List (List I) and  Entry  23  \nof  the State   List   (List II)  of  the  Seventh   Schedule of the Constitution  of  India.   The  \nMines   and  Minerals ( Development and Regulation)  Act,  1957  (MMDR Act) , lays  down  the  \nlegal   frame -work for  the  regulation  of mines and  development  of  all  minerals other    than   \npetroleum   and   natural   gas.  The  Central Government   has  framed  the  Mineral  Concession   \nRules , 1960  (MCR)  for   regulating grant  of  reconnaissance permits  (RP) , prospecting   licences  \n(PL)   and   mining leases  (ML)    in   respect of all minerals other than   atomic minerals   and  \nminor  minerals.   The State   Governments   have framed the rules in regard to minor minerals . \nThe Central Government   have also framed the Mineral   Conservation   and Development   \nRules, 1988  (MCDR),  for   conservation   and   systematic development   of   minerals.    These \nare   applicable   to   all minerals except coal, atomic minerals and  minor minerals      \n \n3.2.   The   Central   Government in consultation with State Governments shall formulate  the  \nlegal  measures necessary for giving effect to the  new National Mineral Policy, 2008 ,  to    \nensure    basic    uniformity    in     mineral  administration across the country  and   to   ensure   \nthat   the   development   of  mineral  resources  keeps  pace, and is  in  consonance  with  the  national   policy   goals.  The MMDR Act, t he MCR and the MCDR will be amended in line with \nthe policy.  The   regulation   of   mines    and  development   of   mineral  resources  in  \naccordance   with   the  national   goals  and  priorities as spelt out in the policy and the legal \nframework  shal l  be  the   responsibility  of both the Central and the State Governments.  \n \n3.3 In order to make the regulatory environment conducive to private investment the \nprocedures for grant of mineral concessions of all types, such as Reconnaissance Permits, \nProsp ecting Licenses and Mining Leases, shall be transparent and seamless and security of \ntenure shall be guaranteed to the concessionaries. The first -in-time principle in the case of sole \napplicants and the selection criteria in the case of multiple applicants  will be appropriately \nelaborated. Prospecting and mining shall be recognized as independent activities with \ntransferability of concessions playing a key role in mineral sector development.  \n \n4.     ROLE OF THE STATE IN MINERAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \nThe  role to be played by the Central and State Governments in  regard  to  mineral  development  \nhas  been  extensively  dealt in  the  Mines  and Minerals (Development and Regulation)  Act, \n1957  and Rules  made under the Act by  the  Central  Government and  the  State   Governments \nin their  respective  domains.   The provisions  of  the  Act  and the Rules  will  be  reviewed  and  \nharmonised  with  the basic features of the new N ational Mineral Policy .  In fu ture the core \nfunctions of the S tate in mining will be facil itation and regulation of exploration and mining \nactivities of investors and entrepreneurs, provision of infrastructure and tax collection.  In mining \nactivities, there shall be arms length distance  between State agencies (P ublic Sector \nUndertakings ) that mine and those that regulate.  There shall be transparency and fair play in the \nreservation  of ore bodies to State agencies on such areas where private players are not holding or \nhave not applied for exploration or mining, unless security considerations or  specific public \ninterests are involved.  \n \n5.         SURVEY AND EXPLORATION  \n \n5.1.   The Geological Survey of India is the principal agency for geological mapping and    \nregional    mineral     resources assessment of the country.    It shall  be  responsib le  for  drawing  \nup  action oriented plans towards these ends in close cooperation with  all  other  agencies  \nengaged in  this  task.  Detailed exploration   on   land   is   done   by   the Mineral Exploration \nCorporation, Directorates   of Mining and G eology of the State Governments and various Central \nand   State   Public Sector Organisations. In conducting exploration for minerals special attention \nwill be given by these government agencies to the development of strategic minerals through \nsystematic i nvestigation of potential sources which are difficult to otherwise access.  \n 5.2     While these Government agencies will continue to perform the tasks assigned to them for \nexploration and survey, the private sector would in future be the main source of inv estment in  \nreconnaissance and exploration and government agencies will expend public funds primarily in \nareas where private sector investments are not forthcoming despite the desirability of \nprogrammes due to reasons such as high uncertainties. To expedite  completion of reconnaissance \nwork for the entire country as early as possible an open sky policy of non -exclusivity for \nreconnaissance work will be adopted. At the same time to attract large investments and high \ntechnology a new instrument to be known as Large Area Prospecting License will be introduced. \nHowever such bulk minerals which do not need risk investment and high technology will not be \neligible for Large Area Prospecting License. The durations of all concessions will be rationalised \nand areas of operations enlarged suitably within each state.   \n \n5.3     It is necessary to ensure that India’s exclusive economic zone is explored and exploited to \nthe maximum possible extent. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)  and its agencies    are \nentrusted with  the task of sea -bed exploration and mining.  Cooperation between MoES  and GSI \nwill be institutionalised so as to achieve this objective within a time bound framework. The task \nof mapping out the extended economic zone will be expedited and completed withi n the time \nprescribed by the International Sea Convention so that no area of sea bed mining is lost to the \ncountry.  \n \n5.4     Particular  attention  will be given  to  the  survey  and  exploration  of  minerals  in  which  \nthe  country  has a poor resource -cum-reserve  base despite having the geological potential for \nlarge resources. Minerals for which there is demand within the country either for use or for \nexport after processing will be prioritised.  Exploration for lower grade hematite, magnetite, base \nmetals, noble metals, diamonds and high grade Ilmenite will be put on the fast track.   \n \n5.5      Coordination of the regional exploration work by government agencies is at  present  \nbeing  done   by  the  Central  Programming  Board  of  the Geological  S urvey  of  India.  The \ndisaggregated projects are generally discussed in the State Level Committees and other technical \nforums before being incorporated into the annual programme. The existing arrangement shall be \nrevamped to ensure that projects and progr ammes are prioritised in line with the national policy \ngoals and are chalked out after taking into account the exploration work undertaken by the \nprivate sector.  \n \n6. DATA BASE OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND TENEMENTS  \n \n6.1.    The national inventory of mineral re sources will be based on a comprehensive and up to \ndate review of exploration data. In coordination with Geological Survey of India, the Indian \nBureau of Mines will maintain a database in digitised form comprising both a Resource \nInventory and a Tenement R egistry. The resource inventory will be in accordance with the latest version of the UNFC system showing reserves and remaining resources as well in the traditional \nIBM form of resources and probable and proven reserves.  The Tenement Registry will give \ninformation of both Leasehold Areas as well as Freehold Areas in terms of green field, brown \nfield and relinquished areas including areas given up by the GSI and other RP/PL holders as not \npursued. The data would be maintained online giving instant informati on to prospective investors \non what is available for reconnaissance, prospecting and mining. Summaries of work done by \npublic agencies will be kept in the form of meta -data in the public domain and detailed reports \nwill be made available to interested inve stors on cost recovery basis.  \n \n6.2     Data filing requirements will be rigorously applied and all concession holders will be \nsubjected to detailed moni toring in this regard. The lock -in arrangements will be assured and \nreleased data will be integrated with the data generated by the state agencies and made available \nto other prospectors.  \n \n7.     STRATEGY OF MINERAL DEVELOPMENT  \n7.1 General Strategy  \n \nThe  Strategy  for  development  of  any  mineral  should naturally  keep  in  view its ultimate  \nend  uses in terms of demand and supply in the short, medium and long terms.   The  guiding \nprinciple  in  the  strategy of development  of  any  mineral  or mineral   deposit  at  any  location  \nshall  ordinarily  be  the economic cost of recovery i.e extraction cost relative to market price and \nwill hence be determined by the market. However, a disaggregated approach in respect of each \nmineral will be adopted  and a mineral specific strategy will be developed. To maximise gains \nfrom the comparative advantage which the country enjoys intra se  mineral development will be \nprioritised in terms of import substitution, value addition and export, in that order.  \n \n7.2.   Conservation and Mineral Development  \n \nConservation  of minerals shall be construed not  in  the restrictive    sense   of   abstinence   \nfrom   consumption    or preservation   for  use in the distant future  but  as  a   positive   concept \nleading to au gmentation of  reserve base  through improvement in  mining methods,  \nbeneficiation  and  utilisation of   low   grade  ore  and  rejects and   recovery  of associated \nminerals.   There shall be an adequate and effective legal and institutional framework mandating \nzero-waste mining as the ultimate goal and a commitment to prevent sub -optimal and \nunscientific mining. Non -adherence to the Mining Plan based on these parameters will carry \nrepercussions. Mineral sectoral value addition through latest techniques o f beneficiation, \ncalibration, blending, sizing, concentration, pelletisation, purification and general customisation \nof product will be encouraged. This is particularly important in iron ore mining as about 80% of \nthe iron ore produced in the country is in  the form of Fines and to promote such value addition \nfiscal and non fiscal incentives will be considered. A thrust will be given to exploitation of mineral resources in which the country is well endowed so that the needs of domestic industry \nare fully met  keeping in mind both present and future needs, while at the same time exploiting \nthe external markets for such minerals.  \n \n7.3   Scientific Methods of Mining  \n \nMine  development and mineral conservation as governed  by the   rules   and  regulations  will  \nbe  on   sound   scientific basis, with the regulatory agencies, viz. IBM and the State Directorates, \nclosely  interacting with R&D organisation,  and scientific  and  professional   bodies to ensure \noptimal Mining Plans. Conditions  of  mining  leases  re garding   size,  shape, disposition   with   \nreference  to  geological   boundaries   and other   mining  conditions  shall  be  such  as   to   \nfavourably predispose   the   leased  areas  to  systematic   and   complete extraction of minerals. \nThe regula tory agencies, namely the India n Bureau of Mines and the State Directorates will be \nsuitably strengthened through capacity building measures.  \n \n7.4   Mining as an Industry with Linkages  \n \nMining contributes to the generation of wealth and creation of employm ent independently and \nshould therefore be treated as an economic activity in its own right and not merely as an ancillary \nactivity of manufacturing industry.  Domestic processing industry receives supplies of mineral \nresources produced by the mining indust ry at market prices prevailing from time to time.  In \norder to be assured of uninterrupted supply of the mineral raw material from domestic sources \nthe user industry will be encouraged to develop long -term linkages with the mineral producing \nunits includin g equity participation in such mining companies .  The mineral  processing  unit \nshould  not  only  get  an assured  supply  of  the  mineral  raw material   but   should   also  have   \nclose   links   with   the production  and  marketing  agencies of  the   mineral  based  end \nproducts. Mining as a backward linkage and Value addition within the same state as a forward \nlinkage will, therefore, be encouraged.  \n \n7.5   Mining Equipment and Machinery  \n \nIndigenous industry for manufacture of mining equipment and ma chinery shall be strengthened. \nInduction of foreign technology and participation for this purpose will be encouraged. Use of \nequipment and machinery which improve the efficiency, productivity and economics of mining \noperations and safety and health of pers ons working in the mines and surrounding areas shall be \nencouraged. Import of such equipment and machinery shall be freely allowed.  \n \n \n \n 7.6.   Manpower Development  \nExisting  facilities  for basic and  specialised  training  shall be constantly  reviewed and \nupgraded from  time  to  time  to  ensure  that  adequately trained manpower at  all  levels  is  \navailable   for   the   development   of   mines   and   mineral s.  \n \nIn  order to improve the competitive edge of the  national mining  industry,  emphasis  shall  be  \nlaid  on   mechanisation, computerisation   and   automation  of  the  existing   and   new mining  \nunits.   The man power development programme shall b e suitably reoriented for the purpose.  \n \nAs the mining sector takes off, the country will need more and more mining engineers, \ngeologists, geo -physicists, geo -chemists and geo -instrumentation specialists. A comprehensive \nreview of the sector’s man power ne eds will be undertaken and educational institutions will be \ngeared to meeting these needs in the medium and long term.  \n \n7.7. Infrastructure Development  \n \nMineral deposits generally occur in remote and backward areas with poor infrastructural   \nfacilities   which   often inhibit   their optimum development. A major thrust needs   to   be   \ngiven to development of infrastructural facilities in mineral bearing areas with special emphasis \non Linking Infrastructure. Financial resources available with government w ill be leveraged to the \nmaximum extent possible through recourse to user charge based public -private -partnership \narrangements wherever possible by providing an institutional framework. An enabling \nenvironment will be created to motivate large capacity mini ng companies to undertake \nconstruction of transportation net works (road and rail) on their own.  \n \nThe contribution of mineral development to regional and more specifically peripheral \ndevelopment, commensurate with the huge investment in large mining projec ts, is substantial.  In \nso far as public funding of infrastructure is concerned a  much greater thrust will be given to \ndevelopment of health, education, drinking water, road and other related facilities and \ninfrastructure in mineral bearing areas so that an integrated approach emerges, encompassing \nmineral development, regional development and the social and economic well being of  the local, \nand particularly, tribal population.  \n \n \n7.8 Financial Support for Mining   \nMining is an eligible activity for obtaining f inancial support    from   financial   institutions.    \nHowever, at present   only those mining projects   which   have a substantial   component   of   \nmining machinery,   equipment   and buildings   are being financed. Steps  shall  be  taken  to  \nfacili tate   financing  of  mine development  and  also  of exploration  integral  to  the  mining \nproject.   \nProspecting being a high risk venture, access to “risk funds” from capital markets and venture \nfunds will be facilitated. Early stage Exploration and Min ing companies will be encouraged and \ndifferential listing requirements through segmented exchanges will be explored. Induction of \nforeign technology and foreign participation in exploration and mining for high   value   and   \nscarce minerals   shall be pur sued.   Foreign equity investment in joint ventures for exploration \nand mining promoted by Indian Companies will be encouraged.    \n \n7.9 Small Deposits  \n \nSmall and isolated deposits of minerals are scattered all over the country. These often lend \nthemselves to e conomic exploitation   through   small   scale mining. With modest demand on \ncapital expenditure and short lead -time, they provide employment opportunities for the local \npopulation. However, due to diseconomies of scale they can also lead to sub -optimal mi ning and \necological disturbance. Efforts will be  made to promote small scale mining of  small  deposits  \nin  a  scientific and efficient manner while safeguarding  vital environmental and ecological   \nimperatives. Regulation of these conditionalities will  be tightened so as to control and prevent \nthe growth of illegal mining    \n \nWhere small deposits are not susceptible to viable mining a cluster approach will be adopted by \ngranting the deposits together as a single lease within a geographically defined bou ndary. Efforts \nwould be made to grant such mineral concessions to consortia of small scale miners so that such \nclusters of small deposits will enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale.  \n \nIn grant of   mineral concessions for small deposits in Scheduled Areas, preference shall be given \nto Scheduled Tribes singly or as cooperatives.  \n \n \n7.10. Mineral Development & Protection of Environment  \n \nExtraction  of  minerals closely impacts  other  nat ural  resources  like  land,  water, air  and  \nforest.   The  areas  in  which  minerals  occur  often have  other  resources  presenting a  choice  \nof  utilisation  of the   resources.   Some such areas are ecologically   fragile and some are \nbiologically  rich.   It  is  necessary  to  take a comprehensive   view  to  facilitate  the  choice  or  \norder   of land  use  keeping  in  view the needs  of  development  as  well as   needs   of   \nprotecting   the   forests,   environment   and ecology.   Both  as pects  have  to  be  properly  \ncoordinated  to facilitate  and  ensure  a  sustainable  development  of  mineral resources in \nharmony with environment.  \n Mining activity often leads to environmental problems like land  degradation in  opencast mining \nand  la nd subsidence  in underground  mining, deforestation, atmospheric   pollution,   pollution  \nof  rivers   and   streams, soil erosion due disposal   of  solid  wastes like overburden and so on, \nall  affecting   the   ecological balance  of  the  area.  Open -cast mining in areas with actual forest   \ncover   leads   to   deforestation.    Prevention    and mitigation  of  adverse  environmental  \neffects  due  to   mining  of  minerals  and  repairing  and   re -vegetation of the affected forest \narea and land co vered by trees in accordance with the latest internationally acceptable norms and \nmodern afforestation practices  shall form integral part of mine development  strategy in every \ninstance.  All mining shall be undertaken within the parameters of a comprehen sive Sustainable \nDevelopment Framework which will be so devised as to take all these aspects into consideration. \nThe guiding principle shall be that a miner shall leave the mining area in better ecological shape \nthan he found it.  \n \nMining operations shall n ot ordinarily be taken up in identified    ecologically   fragile   and   \nbiologically    rich areas.    Strip  mining  in  forest  areas  should    be  avoided  and  it  should  \nbe  permitted  only  when accompanied    with    comprehensive    time -bound    reclamation \nprogramme.  \n \nNo mining lease would be granted to any party, private or public,   without   a   proper   mining   \nplan   including the environmental management plan approved and enforced by statutory   \nauthorities. The  environmental   manage ment   plan should  adequately  provide  for  controlling  \nthe  environmental damage, restoration  of  mined  areas  and  for   planting   of trees   according   \nto   the  prescribed  norms. As   far   as possible, reclamation   and   afforestation    will     proceed \nconcurrently with mineral extraction.  \n \nEfforts would be made to convert old disused mining sites into forests and other appropriate \nforms of land use.  \n \n7.11 Relief & Rehabilitation of Displaced and Affected Persons  \n \nMining operations often  involve acquisition of land held by individuals including those \nbelonging to the weaker sections. In all such cases a social impact assessment will be undertaken \nto ensure that suitable Relief and Rehabilitation packages are evolved. While compensation is  \ngenerally paid to the owner for his acquired land, rehabilitation of affected persons in the form of \nsubstitute land, land for housing and jobs is not always adequate. Appropriate compensation will \nform an important aspect of the Sustainable Development F ramework mentioned in para 2.3 and \n7.10 above. In so far as indigenous (tribal)  populations are concerned the Framework shall \nincorporate models of stakeholder interest for them in the mining operation, especially  in \nsituations where  the  weaker  sectio ns  like the local tribal populations are likely  to  be  \ndeprived  of  their  means  of  livelihood  as  a result of the mining intervention.  In areas in which minerals occur and which are inhabited by tribal communities and weaker \nsections it is imperat ive to recognize resettlement and rehabilitation issues as intrinsic to the \ndevelopment process of the affected zone.  Thus all measures proposed to be taken will be \nformulated with the active participation of the affected persons, rather than externally i mposed.  \nA careful assessment of the economic, environmental and social impact on the affected persons \nwill be made.  A mechanism will be evolved which would actually improve the living standards \nof the affected population and ensure for them a sustainable  income above the poverty line.  For \nthis purpose, all the provisions of the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy or any \nrevised Policy or Statute that may come into operation, will be followed.  \n  \n7.12 Mine Closures  \n \nOnce the  process  of  econo mical  extraction  of  a mine is  complete  there  is  need  for \nscientific mine  closure which will not only restore ecology and regenerate bio mass but also take \ninto account the socio -economic aspects of such closure.  Where mining   activities  have  b een  \nspread  over a few decades,  mining  communities  get  established  and  closure  of the mine \nmeans  not  only  loss  of  jobs  but  also  disruption of  community  life.   Whenever  mine  \nclosure   becomes   necessary,   it   should   be   orderly   and  systematic  and  so  planned  as to  \nhelp  the  workers  and  the  dependent   community  rehabilitate  themselves   without   undue  \nhardship.  \n \n7.13. Mine Safety  \n \nMining operations are hazardous in nature.   Accidents  happen  and  often  result  in  the  loss  of  \nlife  or  limb  of  persons  engaged  in  it.   Efforts  must  be  directed   towards  the  development  \nand  adoption of  mining  methods  which  would  increase  the  safety  of  workers  and  reduce  \nthe   accidents.  Towards   this end, participation and cooperation   of   mine workers   shall be \nsecured.   Steps  will  also  be  taken   to  minimise   the  adverse  impact  of  mining  on  the  \nhealth   of  workers and the surrounding population.  \n \n8.     FOREIGN TRADE  \n \nMinerals continue to be an important source of foreign exchange earnings.   The  policy of export \nshall  keep  in  view  the dynamics of  mineral  inventories as well as the short, medium  and long  \nterm  needs  of  the  country.   Efforts  shall  be made  to  export  minerals  in  value  added  form  \nas  far as  possible.      The  indigenous   mineral  industry   shall  be  attuned  to  the   \ninternational   economic  situation  in  order   to derive maximum  advantage  from  foreign  trade   \nby   carefully   anticipating   technology   and   demand  changes   in   the   international  market   \nfor   minerals.  \n The import of mineral based material shall be coordinated as   far   as possibl e with the \nindigenous   development   of mineral   based   industries.    Areas   of   cooperation    with \ncountries    with   complementary   resource   base   shall    be developed for mutual advantage.   \nThe approach   shall be to make available mineral  based materials to domestic users at \nreasonable prices as determined by market forces.  \n \nA long term export policy would provide stability and prove to be an incentive for investing in \nlarge scale commercial mining activity.  To develop mining as a modern stand alone industry \nsubstantial investment is required. Assurances on export of minerals will be a key factor for \ninvestment decisions particularly on FDI in the sector.  The Export Policy should be based on a \nclear long term strategy for export of minera ls taking these aspects into consideration.  \n \n9.     FISCAL ASPECTS  \n \nIt will be the endeavour of government, within the context of the budget, to design fiscal \nmeasures conducive to the promotion of mineral exploration and development including \nbeneficiatio n and other forms of product refinement.  In the context of the   changing mineral \nscenario and the economies of mineral development and products, both at the national and \ninternational level fiscal changes will be examined from time to time consistent wit h the general \ntax structure and through the normal budgetary process.  Mineral prices should reflect their value \nand the royalty structures will be designed to ensure that the producer earns and the consumer \npays the true value of the minerals produced and  consumed. The fiscal dispensation will \ngenerally aim to ensure that adequate compensation is forthcoming to the state in return for the \nconcessions it grants.  \n \n10. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  \n \n10.1. General Approach   \n \nResearch  and development in the mineral  sector  has  to cover  the  entire  gamut of  activities  \nfrom  geological survey, exploration, mining, beneficiation, concentration  of minerals  to \ndevelopment of materials.  Efforts  will  be  directed towards  the  development  of  new \ntechnologies   for  conv ersion  of  existing  mineral   resources into   viable  economic  resources.    \nAppropriate   technologies shall   be   developed  to  enable   indigenous   industries   to utilise   \nthe  mineral  resources  with  which  the  country   is abundantly   end owed  and  as  substitutes  \nfor  minerals   whose reserves  are  poor.   R&D efforts shall be directed to find new   and \nalternative uses for minerals   whose   traditional demand is on the wane. Indigenous technology \nhas to be upgraded through research an d   appropriate absorption and adoption   of   \ntechnological innovations abroad.   Research  and  development  efforts  shall be  made  to  \nimprove  efficiency  in  process,  operations   and also    the   recovery   of   by -products   and   reduction    i n specification  and  consumption  norms.   Efforts will also   be directed to evolve \nlow capital and energy saving processing systems.  \n \n10.2. Research in Mining Methods  \n \nMining methods determine the safety, economy, speed and the percentage of extraction of the \nore reserves from a mine. Research and development thrust shall be directed specially in the \nareas of rock mechanics, ground control, mine   design engineering, equ ipment   deployment   \nand maintenance,   energy conservation, environmental protection, safety of operations and \nhuman engineering.  \n \n10.3   Mineral Processing and Beneficiation  \n \nAttention will be given to beneficiation and agglomeration techniques to brin g lower grades and \nfiner size   material into use. Research  organisations,  including the  National  Mineral \nProcessing   Laboratories   of  the  Indian   Bureau   of   Mines will be   strengthened  for  \ndevelopment  of   processes   for beneficiation   a nd  mineral  and  elemental  analysis  of   ores \nand   ore   dressing  products.   There shall   be   cooperation between and coordination among all \norganisations in public and private sector engaged in this task. Research  and  development  shall \nbe  orie nted  to  ensure maximum   economic  recovery  of  the  associated  minerals   and \nvaluable metals.  \n \n10.4 Development Of Automated Equipment  \n \nTo  meet the objective of safety and  economic  production attention   will  be  given  to  the  \ndevelopment  of   robotics, automated  equipment  and  system  for  mining,  especially   for deep \nmining and transportation to surface.  \n \n10.5.  Deep Sea Mining  \n \nIndia is a pioneer investor and has been allocated a mine site   of   150,000 square kilometres in \nIndian   O cean   for exclusive   survey   and exploration.   Deep   ocean   resources represent an \nexceptionally large and potentially   important mineral   resource.    Integrated   systems   for    \nexploration, exploitation,   mining   and processing   of   these   resources shall   be   expedited \nwith   the   development/acquisition   of necessary     technologies.     Appropriate     mechanism     \nfor coordinating   the survey and exploration of Deep Sea   Bed Area    will   be established by \nthe   Ministry of Ea rth Sciences .  \n \n \n 10.6  Production Of Materials Of High Purity  \n \nResearch  will be directed towards raw materials  required  for   production  of  materials  of  \nhigh  purity  for   use   in  advanced   technology  applications  such   as   semi -conductors,   \nphoto -voltaic,   lasers,  special  sensors,   high   temperature  new    ceramics,   hard   and   high    \ntemperature    materials,  superconductors,   insulators,  very  thin  films,  glasses   and  liquid \ncrystals and metal and mineral fibres.  \n \n10.7.  Coordination Of Research Organisations  \n \nResearch and development activities in the mineral  sector are  carried  out  in  the  national  \nlaboratories,   educational institutions   and  R&D  units  of  public  and  private   sector \nenterprises.   Pooling  of  resources  and  expertise   available in  the  various  R&D \nOrganisations is  imperative  to  meet  the challenges  and  to  fulfil  the  tasks  ahead  in  the   \nmineral sector.    Linkages   and   interaction   between   the   various institutions  en gaged  in  \nR&D in the  mineral  sector  shall  be strengthened  to  derive  the maximum  benefit.   \nInterchange of scientists   between   institutions shall   be   encouraged   to accelerate the pace of \ninteraction. It shall also be ensured that the resear ch findings are made available to users \nexpeditiously. There shall   be   cooperation between and coordination among all organisations in \nthe public and private sectors engaged in this task.  \n \nMining methods determine the safety, economy, speed and the per centage of extraction of the \nore reserves from a mine. Research and development thrust needs to be  directed in areas of such \nas rock mechanics, ground  control, mine design engineering, equipment deployment and \nmaintenance, energy conservation, environmen tal protection, safety of  operations and human \nengineering. This has to be done in a holistic way so that inter -linkages are established to the \nadvantage of each segment. To this end the diverse research, development and training initiatives \nwithin the pu blic domain shall be reorganised into a single and cohesive R & D and Training \ninstitution of excellence to be known as the National Institute of Mineral Development. \nOrganizations such as the  National  Mineral Processing   Laboratories of the Indian Bure au of \nMines, the National Institute of Rock mechanics, the Jawaharlal National Institute of Aluminium \nResearch and Development, the R & D initiatives of the Geological Survey of India will be \njoined to provide a collective thrust.  \n \n11.    CONCLUSIONS  \n \nMineral wealth, though finite and non -renewable in the long term, is a major resource for \ndevelopment.   The  need for a well planned programme of survey and exploration, management  \nof  resources which have already been discovered and those which are in t he process of \ndiscovery  and  their optimal, economical and timely use are  matters  of national  importance.   The success of the second national mineral policy will depend largely on a national consensus   \nto fulfil its underlying principles and objectiv es.  \n……  "
